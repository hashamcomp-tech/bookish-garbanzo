  <h1>My Test</h1>

  
  
  <p> “Why?” Han Sen’s lip curled a little.
“If you want the relic, then give her to me. Otherwise, don’t even think about it. The choice is yours.” The princess’ face didn’t change.
“Fine. Whatever. She is just a useless kid. If you want her, then you can have her.” Han Sen rolled his eyes and returned to the building. He brought out Bao’er and lobbed her toward the princess.
The princess frowned. She caught Bao’er and immediately turned away from Han Sen. She took Bao’er away from the garden. She moved hurriedly, as if remaining in the garden for one more second would make her feel incredibly filthy.
Bao’er lay across the princess’ shoulder, clutching her neck. She winked at Han Sen.
“D*mn woman... Don’t let me find a chance...” Han Sen grumbled, but he winked back at Bao’er.
The princess wanted Bao’er, and Han Sen needed Bao’er to amass information on his behalf. Bao’er’s intelligence and power made her a great infiltrator.
Bai Wei and the princess didn’t give Han Sen any further headaches. He was most worried about the meeting with Bai Ling Shuang, and that was because Han Sen wasn’t sure what sort of deal had been established between Bai Ling Shuang and Bai Yi. He didn’t know what Bai Ling Shuang had offered Bai Yi to make him hunt Han Sen down in Knight’s Paradise.
But Han Sen needed to go to Night Charm Town. Bai Yi would definitely have chosen to go there if he had returned from his confrontation with Han Sen.
Fortunately, Han Sen was able to read all the information that Mister White had given him before the meeting. He knew what sort of social circles Bai Yi traveled in. At the very least, he knew a thing or two about Bai Yi now.
At the proposed time of the meet, Han Sen rode the blood kirin and left Planet Water Zone, heading for Bai Ling Shuang’s Night Charm Town.
Bai Ling Shuang was different from Bai Yi and Bai Wei. She had an abundance of resources. Night Charm Town was like a top club located in King’s Kingdom, but it was only one of Bai Ling Shuang’s many properties.
It was a town, yes, but it was one that covered an entire planet. Because Night Charm Town was very famous among the Extreme King, finding information about the place wasn’t difficult. Han Sen made sure to do his homework before he left. Hopefully, nothing there would be strange to him.
“Go and tell your master that Prince Sixteen Bai Yi is here,” Han Sen said to the receptionist, slapping the woman’s butt and squeezing it firmly. He spoke aloud with much pride.
“My Prince, Night Charm Town doesn’t allow xenogeneics.” The receptionist kept a fixed smile on her face, but her eyes revealed the glint of simmering anger.
“You don’t accept people’s xenogeneics? Well, the xenogeneic of Bai Yi is an exception to your rule,” Han Sen said, then walked forward with the blood kirin.
The faces of the guards changed. They stepped forward as if to stop him, but they then returned to their posts.
There were many noble snobs around there. Compared to Bai Yi, though, those people were pleasant. No one liked Bai Yi, not even the workers.
“Please wait, My Prince. The princess is coming.” The receptionist took Han Sen to a room on the highest floor, then left.
“The Extreme King really know how to enjoy themselves.” Han Sen sat on a sofa and looked around. He stroked the blood kirin’s head as he thought.
“Brother Sixteen, you only have one half-deified xenogeneic. You don’t have to show-off twenty-four-seven.” Bai Ling Shuang walked in and looked at the blood kirin as she spoke.
“Half-deified xenogeneic? This is nothing in your eyes, of course, but to a useless prince such as myself, it is very important. I need to bring it around often.” Han Sen grabbed a glass of wine and drank it. He looked at Bai Ling Shuang. His smile didn’t reach his eyes, and he said, “By the way, thank you for your kindness. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be receiving this.”
Bai Ling Shuang didn’t want to talk to Han Sen more than necessary. She threw something towards him and clapped her hands.
A very attractive woman came in. She stepped up next to Bai Ling Shuang and bowed. Then, she bowed to Han Sen and said, “My name is Cher. It is nice to meet you, My Prince.”
Cher’s body was very attractive, and her eyes could snare a person’s soul. Her voice was like a hook that could draw the attention of all.
“Fox!” Han Sen’s eyes widened as he looked at Cher. He was given a fright. She had fox ears and a fox tail behind her.
“The Extreme King’s Pavilion Pass and Cher are now yours for the day. You should be sufficiently satisfied,” Bai Ling Shuang said emotionlessly.
“You had so much faith in me, Sister Ten.” Han Sen looked at Cher. He pulled her into his arms and reached right into her clothing.
Cher was smiling, but inside, he knew that she hated this.
Bai Ling Shuang coldly grunted and left the room. Han Sen now had a headache. He should have thought more about what Bai Yi would have asked for. As a request from Bai Yi, this sadly made sense.
The Extreme King Pavilion Pass surprised Han Sen, though. He hadn’t been in the Extreme King long, but he had heard about the Extreme King’s Pavilion.
Only the royal children that were rewarded by King Bai were granted a pass. This was an item that allowed one to get into the Extreme King’s Pavilion. One pass could provide one entry.
The legends said that there were many legendary treasures there, and that only the royal children were ever allowed access to them. If one was not a royal child, it would be pointless to have the pass.
Bai Yi had never received a pass before. Han Sen hadn’t expected that the deal with Bai Ling Shuang would earn him an Extreme King’s Pavilion Pass. The unexpected revelation made Han Sen very happy.
In the Extreme King’s Pavilion, randomly selected treasures could be bought for high prices. This was a surprise to Han Sen.
But the other part of Bai Yi’s deal, his desire for a woman—and a Fox woman at that—left Han Sen unsure of how to proceed.
With Bai Yi’s personality, he would have undoubtedly gone crazy all over the Fox woman.
But Han Sen wasn’t Bai Yi. He liked pretty girls too, but he didn’t want to do anything with a woman he didn’t know.
And most importantly, the room had a camera. Han Sen didn’t have a fetish for being watched.
But right now, he was disguised as Bai Yi. Leaving a woman that Bai Yi had always dreamed of without doing anything would inspire suspicion from Bai Ling Shuang.
Han Sen even thought Bai Ling Shuang was probably sitting behind a monitor of the camera’s feed, watching his every move.
Han Sen held Cher by the waist, trying to think about how he might deal with the situation.
“My Prince, this is my first time. Please be gentle...” Cher looked down. Her face seemed red, and the skin of her chest was flushed a little pink. She looked very charming. Seeing her would make anyone feel horny.

Cher’s beauty would make anyone’s heart jump, but in Han Sen’s eyes, she was completely unappealing.
Han Sen had seen many beautiful people in the world. There were countless numbers of them, but he was now past the stage in which he took people for their face value. What was inside was better than what was outside.
Cher looked as if she absolutely despised Bai Yi. That attractiveness she displayed was for a specific purpose, and she showed her body to achieve it. Ordinary people might have been drawn to that, but Han Sen thought it was boring.
Cher wasn’t Han Sen’s type. Even if he really liked her, he wouldn’t do anything with a woman so easily.
But right now, if Han Sen didn’t do something, he would raise suspicions about his identity.
The evil, horny Bai Yi wouldn’t think twice about doing something devilish to that pretty woman.
Bai Ling Shuang wouldn’t believe Han Sen’s lie if he showed restraint.
Han Sen picked up Cher by the waist and took her to the bed.
Cher lay against Han Sen’s chest. She looked so shy, and her arms were around Han Sen’s neck.
When Han Sen put Cher down on the bed, her pretty eyes looked into Han Sen’s own at a very close distance. There was only ten centimeters separating the two.
Han Sen’s eyes shifted away to break the gaze. He wanted to use a geno art, but Cher’s eyes looked very weird. They were magnetic, pulling directly on peoples’ hearts. He was going to get lost in her attractive eyes.
Han Sen’s heart skipped a beat. He gave up on casting a geno art, looking genuinely attracted by her. He had seen these eyes before when he was trapped in Ghost Bone Palace; Fox Queen had tried to trick him the same way. He hadn’t expected Cher to have a command of this ability, as well.
It wasn’t hard to tell that she was one of the Fox. They were two of the same race, and that talent could very well have been a defining ability of the Foxes. It wasn’t too strange that Cher knew how to do this, but compared to Fox Queen, Cher was an amateur.
Cher’s power still surprised Han Sen, though. She was King class for sure, and Han Sen hadn’t been able to tell that before this moment.
The Fox had a skill that hid their strength, and it was very effective.
But thinking about how Fox Queen hid herself as a King class guard amidst the Extreme King despite being deified, this wasn’t half as special.
Han Sen was familiar with this geno art, so he knew what the expected reaction should be. Han Sen’s eyes started to look dazed, as if he was frozen. But he sighed.
A while later, Han Sen looked dazed while lying on Cher. He was like a zombie.
“This Cher is using a luring skill to get me to fall under a spell. She is trying to make me think that I’m going to do something with her. Most people wouldn’t realize what was happening. I wonder if this was her idea, or if it was Bai Ling Shuang who ordered her to do this?” Han Sen wondered. He thought it was more likely to be the second option.
Cher looked at Han Sen with revulsion as she pushed him away. She sat up on the bed and tidied her clothes. She looked utterly disgusted.
A hidden door in the room opened, and Bai Ling Shuang walked in.
Cher bowed to her and said, “My Princess, I used Fox Eye to attract him. He won’t know what happened.”
Bai Ling Shuang nodded. “Good job. Take off his clothes and remove everything. I want to get a proper look at him.”
“My Princess, do you think something is wrong with Prince Sixteen?” Cher asked.
“Not quite... I just feel as if something is amiss with him,” Bai Ling Shuang said.
“It looks like my attempts to imitate Bai Yi are failing,” Han Sen thought as he heard Cher approach him. “Why hasn’t blood kirin reacted?”
Bai Ling Shuang and Cher were there. Han Sen was worried they were going to expose him. He didn’t dare to use his Dongxuan Aura to get a look around the room. He thought the blood kirin was just lying there and not moving. His presence seemed normal, as if he was just sleeping.
But Han Sen knew that the blood kirin couldn’t actually be sleeping. Even if it was, Bai Ling Shuang’s entry surely should have woken it. It was just lying there and not moving. Something must have happened.
Cher moved calmly over to Han Sen and removed all of his clothes. Han Sen just had to remain still; otherwise, everything would fall apart.
Cher brought Han Sen’s clothes and items over to Bai Ling Shuang. Bai Ling Shuang looked through the stuff and said, “This Ghost Teeth Knife is Han Sen’s. This silver thunder blade thing is also Han Sen’s. It could actually be a half-deified weapon. This Jade Drum looks different from the ordinary Jade Drums. Maybe it is a mutant Jade Drum. These items must be Han Sen’s. He certainly got lucky.”
“Why does he only carry Han Sen’s items? Could this be a problem?” Cher frowned.
Han Sen’s heart tightened. He had wanted to carry some of Bai Yi’s items, but they had all been eaten by the blue metal wolf. He had nothing, and there was nothing decent in his house. Han Sen only found some accessories to wear, but there were no xenogeneic treasures or King class items.
Bai Ling Shuang coldly said, “Bai Yi is addicted to sex and gambling. His family didn’t lose because he married Lan Haixin. But that Lan Haixin had her own purposes for marrying him. She isn’t really in love with Bai Yi. What she holds onto won’t be given to Bai Yi. Bai Yi should be a prince, but he is little more than a servant. His situation is quite bad. If things weren’t like this, he wouldn’t have been greedy enough to request my Extreme King’s Pavilion Pass.”
“He got lucky that he was chosen to kill Han Sen. That is a lot to be rewarded with. That Han Sen was special, but he was also so dumb. He went for that b*tch Bai Wei. He deserved to die.” Bai Ling Shang looked through everything and tossed the items away. She walked to the secret door and went on to say, “Go and find a woman of the Pig race. We need to make it look legit. Don’t let this *sshole wonder about anything after waking up.”
“F*ck you, lady. Do you have to be this cruel? This is so f*cking cruel!” Han Sen thought. The Pig people had a human body but a pig head. They were so strong, too. They were little more than thralls.
Bai Ling Shuang was going to put a Pig in bed with him. Han Sen wanted to jump up and kill her.
Cher brought Han Sen’s items over to the bed and threw them down. She brought a leg up and kicked Han Sen’s body hard. She hissed angrily, “You dare to touch me? Wait until later.”
After that, Cher turned around to call for the Pig woman. Han Sen thought quickly, and in the end, he could no longer keep this up. The moment Cher turned around, Han Sen jumped up. He grabbed her back and used his hand to cover her mouth as he threw her on the bed.
Jadeskin’s ice power and Original Water King Body’s King area-of-effect combined and flowed into Cher’s body. She was caught completely off guard, and she was frozen on the spot.
But she was King class, and she tried to fight back. Han Sen’s ice power was melting fast due to her resistance.

“Should I kill her or not?” Han Sen thought to himself.
Cher’s power was stronger than Han Sen had expected. His ice powers didn’t work on her very well, and when Han Sen saw that Cher was about to free herself, he knew that her escaping would result in him being exposed.
But killing Cher wouldn’t exactly make him appear less suspicious, either.
This was Night Charm Town. It wasn’t a place where people were murdered for resources like Knight’s Paradise. In this town, people were required to follow the laws established by the Extreme King. Not even a prince could randomly murder someone with proper cause.
Han Sen’s eyes flashed. Cher, who was currently crushed under Han Sen, was overwhelmed with both anger and fear. She had been fully confident that her Fox Eyes would work on Han Sen, so she had been caught completely off guard when he turned the tables on her.
Fortunately, her own powers were rather impressive. She was stronger than Bai Yi, and she had a high resistance to ice. She couldn’t be bound easily.
Seeing that Cher was about to escape the ice, Han Sen leaned over next to her ear and whispered, “Cher, do you remember Fox Queen?”
When Cher heard this, she shivered. Her attempts to struggle away from him suddenly ceased. Soon after, though, she returned to normal, trying to fight her way free as if she hadn’t heard what Han Sen had just asked her.
Han Sen knew which way the wind was blowing, so he let go of Cher and coldly said, “I am very close with Fox Queen; if that claim was untrue, then you know that I would already be a dead man. So, you had better be quiet and talk. If something happens to me, something will happen to Fox Queen, too.”
“Why would I believe you?” Cher broke through the last of the ice that caked her body, but she didn’t jump away after she freed herself.
Han Sen brought his mouth close to Cher and spoke the two words quietly. “Red Sleeve.”
Cher’s jaw went slack. Clearly, she was aware that Red Sleeve was Fox Queen.
Han Sen now felt much safer. He laid down on Cher and said quietly, “I’m sorry to invade your personal space, but I’m sure you can understand my situation. Can you tell me how I might manage to get through this?”
“You are Han Sen?” Cher wasn’t stupid; not many of the Foxes were. She knew what was really going on, but she just found it hard to believe.
Han Sen was a Duke, and Bai Yi’s Return to Origin had failed. Han Sen had ended up killing Prince Bai Yi, then assumed the man’s identity as a disguise. He was so brave it was almost impossible to fathom.
Han Sen knew that he couldn’t hide his knowledge of Fox Queen, but this was the best result he would be able to achieve, given the current circumstances.
They both had dirt on each other. Han Sen thought that a Fox wouldn’t sell him out unless they absolutely had to.
“What do you say?” Han Sen smiled at Cher.
Many different emotions flickered across Cher’s face. After a while, she gritted her teeth and said, “Wait for me on the bed. I am going to call the Pig lady.”
“Don’t even think about it. If I was willing to do that, why would I have exposed myself?” Han Sen crushed Cher to the bed to keep her from moving.
Cher blushed and said, “If I don’t go, Bai Ling Shuang will notice. Do not worry; I will use a geno art to control the Pig lady. Put on your clothes and wait for me, just don’t get off the bed. Only the bed isn’t faced with a camera.”
“Okay, I will take your word on it this one time.” Han Sen rolled over to the other side of the bed, grabbed his clothes, and put on his garments one by one.
Cher glanced at Han Sen and walked out.
While Han Sen was pulling on his clothes, he receded into thought. When Cher came back, she brought someone who was three meters tall and had a waist that was eight feet wide. It was the Pig.
But it seemed as if the Pig lady was under a spell. Her eyes looked dull, and she listened to Cher’s every command. She fell down on the bed, and the bed made a chorus of squeaky noises.
Cher looked at Han Sen and murmured, “In order to make this work, I need you to make some noise.”
Not long after, Cher took the Pig woman away. She came back and lay down next to Han Sen wearing only a bathrobe.
“How did you disguise yourself as Prince Sixteen?” Cher asked as she lay looking at Han Sen.
“That wasn’t difficult. What about you? You are so young, and you’re surrounded by the elite of the Extreme King. Your life must be hard,” Han Sen said with a broad smile.
“Couldn’t you show a little gratitude? I just saved your life. If I hadn’t, you would have had to do it with that Pig...” When she realized what she was saying, Cher blushed and stopped talking.
“Out of all the Foxes that I have met, you are the least shameless. You seem to be very pure, yet you’ve also managed to achieve King class. You must be quite famous among the Foxes,” Han Sen said with a smile.
Cher raised her red lips in a slight sneer. “Are you trying to get information out of a Fox? You are too naive.”
“We are merely making a trade. You think too much.” Han Sen coughed.
Han Sen was very interested in Fox Queen’s conspiracy. If a woman like Fox Queen was willing to disguise herself as a female guard, then something big had to be going down.
Han Sen had intended to glean more information from Cher. She was so pure that she looked rather inexperienced. But she actually seemed smart enough to deprive him of hope.
Cher moved her face closer to Han Sen. She was facing him, and she was so near that she almost touched Han Sen’s nose. They could feel each other’s breath.
“What are you doing? I have standards, you know,” Han Sen said with a blink.
“You really are Han Sen?” Cher asked curiously, still examining him.
“We are sleeping together, and still you must ask that? I feel rather hurt.” Han Sen lifted his shoulders in a light shrug.
Cher’s eyes looked like moons. She smiled and said, “I thought that we Foxes were very good at changing our identities, but you must be even better. You’ve disguised yourself as Extreme King’s Prince Sixteen and successfully avoided detection. Not even Fox Queen would have the courage to do what you’ve done.”
“I learned a few tricks from Fox Queen that made it possible,” Han Sen said.
Cher’s eyes looked bright. “Are you close with her?”
“Close. Very close. Fox Queen kind of wanted to marry me, but I didn’t want that to happen,” Han Sen casually said.
When Cher heard that, her eyes widened. She didn’t believe the claim. “Liar.”
“Why would I lie? Your Fox Queen’s butt has a...” Han Sen supplied some helpful descriptive details.
Cher looked at Han Sen as if he was a monster. A while later she said, “You and Fox Queen... That... That...”
“I failed her when I turned down her proposal.” Han Sen sighed. “Now I can only make up for it by trying to help her and assuage her grief. If I can do that, I can die a happy man.”
“You are going to help Fox Queen claim our treasure?” Cher felt touched as she spoke.
Han Sen felt a ripple of relief pass through him; Cher was much easier to deal with than other Foxes. While she was King class and strong, she didn’t have much practical experience.
In the morning, Han Sen finally received the Extreme King’s Pavilion Pass and left Night Charm Town. On his way out, he looked over at Cher like he wanted her so badly. Bai Ying Shuang wouldn’t let him near the woman now that their deal was complete, though.
The blood kirin had been sleeping, and nothing happened after it woke up. Han Sen didn’t know what they had done to the creature to make it sleep through the night.
Han Sen rode the blood kirin away from Night Charm Town, heading straight for the Extreme King’s Pavilion. He was in so much danger, and he felt as if he could be exposed at any second. He wanted to use Pavilion Pass as quickly as possible.
Considering Bai Yi’s well-known greed, everyone would expect him to use the pass immediately, anyway.
When he arrived at the Pavilion, Han Sen presented the pass so he could go right on in and select a treasure to take away with him. The blood kirin had to wait for him outside.
But when Han Sen entered the Pavilion, he frowned. The legends said that the place was full of treasures, but Han Sen didn’t see any treasures as he walked inside. There was just a bunch of statues.
The statues were wearing royal armor. Although they were just statues, the sight of them was still very impressive. Each statue must have represented one of the Extreme King’s former rulers.
Aside from those statues, there were no other treasures inside the building. Han Sen found a placard on the wall, and soon realized that the statues themselves were the treasures of the Extreme King’s Pavilion.
During a ruler’s coronation, a statue of the new ruler would be placed inside the Pavilion. The materials used to construct the statues weren’t very valuable, but before the statues were placed in the Pavilion, the kings left their geno arts inside them. If someone with a Pavilion Pass could understand the meaning of one of the geno arts, they would be able to activate the statue. The statue would move to reveal the treasure compartment at its base. Within that compartment would be an item left behind by the ruler.
“If these are items left behind by monarchs, then they must be quite special. But understanding the mind of a king cannot be an easy task to accomplish,” Han Sen thought as he looked at the statues.
Although each statue was unique, they all had a sense of power and mystique. As he looked closer, Han Sen could tell that the statues were all pulling on him in different ways. All of them possessed their own particular atmosphere.
There was seventy-nine of them. That meant at least seventy-nine kings had ruled the Extreme King during their history.
Some statues featured a rock in front of them, whereas others did not. If a statue didn’t have a stone, it meant that the treasure inside had already been taken.
Han Sen counted and realized there were only three of them left. Most of the treasures had already been taken, which meant that the ones left behind would be difficult to claim.
That made sense. The Extreme King had a long history, and there was an abundance of talented individuals among them. Understanding a statue wouldn’t be too difficult.
There were three that no one had managed to understand, though. That was quite odd.
Han Sen had a look at the three statues. Blocks of text were engraved on the back of each statue, chronicling the entire life of the king, feats and all.
The first of the statues that hadn’t been claimed was actually the first statue that Han Sen had seen upon entering. That meant the statue belonged to the Extreme King’s very first ruler, or maybe even their alpha.
The statue’s self-aggrandizement was quite ridiculous. It said that the king was loved by everyone. It spoke of how intelligent and powerful the man was, and how his hands could cripple the entire universe. It said he stabilized the universe for billions of years. Frankly, it just sounded ludicrous. It sounded as if the Extreme King had held the entire universe together.
But Han Sen knew that the Extreme King were once just a minor race. When their alpha was born, Sacred was the reigning superpower. Perhaps the Extreme King alpha had even owed service to the people of Sacred.
That was very likely, because when the Sacred leader spread his dominion over the universe, small races like the Extreme King would have found themselves under the thumb of the Sacred. In reality, most of them would have ended up as vassal races to the Sacred.
The strangest thing, though, was the physical appearance of the Extreme King’s alpha. His statue looked very different than those of the other kings.
The Extreme King looked similar to humans. The first king mostly resembled them, but part of his body was obviously different.
There was a mark on the alpha’s forehead that looked like the closed third eye of a Sky. The Extreme Kings didn’t have a third eye. They were just like humans; they had two eyes with normal pupils.
But then again, Han Sen couldn’t be certain what the marking was supposed to be. It wasn’t open, so he couldn’t be sure that it was actually a third eye.
There was another strange thing about the statue, as well. Every other king possessed a sword, knife, or a book. The alpha didn’t have a sword on his waist or a book in his hand, however; he was holding a gourd.
“This guy is interesting.” Han Sen focused on the alpha’s statue and used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to witness the process of the statue’s creation.
According to the statue’s description, the alpha left the statue in the Extreme King’s Pavilion. The alpha both started this tradition and wrote it down in the rules of the Extreme King, and every king after had performed this ritual. If the ritual wasn’t completed, then they wouldn’t be deemed a true king of the Extreme King.
Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to look at the statue, but before he could analyze a single thing, he felt a burning pain sear into his eye.
“Argh!”
Han Sen lowered his head and held his eye. Thin trails of blood leaked through his fingers.
“That is some strong power.” Han Sen clutched his eye, and it took a while for him to recover. He didn’t dare use the Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine the statue again. Although the Purple-Eye Butterfly was a deified beast soul, the alpha of the Extreme King must have been a very powerful individual. They would have been deified, too. Trying to steal a look into the statue that they left behind was clearly a no-go.
Luckily, Han Sen’s recovery power was strong. If it hadn’t been, his eye would have been destroyed.
Putting away the Purple-Eye Butterfly, Han Sen didn’t look at the Extreme King alpha’s statue again. Instead, he looked at the statue of another king.
That king was holding a book, with his spare hand held behind his back. His eyes looked into the distance, and they conveyed an intimidating sense of incredible strength.
Han Sen observed the statue and noticed how startlingly clear it was. The king had black eyes and black hair. He wasn’t clad in the armor of a king, but instead dressed in a white robe that actually looked rather elegant.
The back of the statue recorded what the king had done. Han Sen learned that this king was called King Wen. The description of his deeds said that he fought wars and claimed races, but that part of his life was summed up in a single sentence. Most of his description explained how he built the system of law and government for the Extreme King.
King Bai was actually following the laws established by King Wen, like the rules to raise the royal children. Through the eras, things had been modified a bit, but the rules remained mostly the same.
King Wen was the second king of the Extreme King. His statue was near the Extreme King alpha.
The final statue that hadn’t been claimed was far in the back. It was the king before King Bai.
Because King Bai was still around, his statue was sealed. Treasure seekers would have to wait until he had passed away before his statue was revealed in the Pavilion.
The statue wasn’t being shown right then to avoid giving his children the opportunity to crack the statue. Why that would have been a bad thing, the stone didn’t say. As a result, Han Sen didn’t understand.
The last king before King Bai was called King Bao. Not much was written about him, just a few words that looked like default-text instead. He had beaten a race and expanded the breadth of the Extreme King’s domain, but the name of the race he had beaten wasn’t even listed.
The expanse controlled by the Extreme King had been maximized during the reign of King Bao, so there wasn’t much room left for them to develop nowadays unless they could defeat the Very High or Ancient God. There was nothing else King Bai could do.
In fact, the twenty kings before King Bao were all fairly boring. They maintained the Extreme King’s power and developed fairly slowly.
But those other king statues had all been claimed. This boring and normal king statue hadn’t been cracked, though.
Although the King Bao statue was the latest to show up, not many had attempted to understand it. Its plain look might have been why, even though King Bai was known to have some genius kids, like Bai Wuchang and Bai Ling Shuang. They were geniuses with a vast array of talents. Bai Wei was talented, as well, but she lacked fame. There were many royal children of greatness, just hidden away like that. If they didn’t have what it took to claim the King Bao statue, then it had to be special.
Han Sen looked at the three statues. He was unable to use his Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a close-up examination of them. He would need to use his own senses. Plus, no matter how many Pavilion Passes a prince got ahold of, they could never come back once they claimed a statue.
Bai Wuchang had tried to open the alpha statue before, and he wasn’t the only prince that had tried.
Han Sen turned toward the strange face of the alpha statue. “I’ll give this one a try.”
Each statue had a different atmosphere, but Han Sen felt his attention being snared by the gourd that the alpha king was holding. Han Sen couldn’t tell if that was a good thing or a bad thing.
Perhaps because of Bao’er, Han Sen cared a lot about things that resembled a gourd.
King Bao’s name had a Bao in it, but he didn’t have any weapons or interesting items in his hands. He looked so poor, and so that wasn’t what Han Sen wanted.
King Wen didn’t suit Han Sen’s style. Only the alpha king interested Han Sen.
Han Sen sat down before the alpha king statue and looked up into the man’s eyes.
For some reason, the oppressive aura of the statue felt different when he was sitting down.
If Han Sen looked at the statue while he was on his feet, the statue appeared beautiful and intricately carved. When he sat on the floor, however, it seemed as if the statue was truly coming alive. It was like a living king was standing in front of him, looking at Han Sen with what appeared to be a smile. The emotions it inspired were completely different.
Han Sen was shocked. He moved a little on the stone and looked at the statue again. The statue was back to normal. It didn’t look alive anymore.
Han Sen changed spots a few times, but the results were the same. He could only see the statue’s living-type aura when he sat directly in front of it.
Han Sen ran to King Wen and King Bao’s statues. They were all the same. Only sitting on the stone allowed him to detect the feel of the statues.
“These king statues are amazing. I wonder how they do that.” Han Sen sighed. He returned to his seat in front of the alpha king’s statue and analyzed the feelings inspired by the statue.
When he looked at the alpha, a strange feeling settled over Han Sen. King Wen and King Bao’s statues gave Han Sen the feeling that he was sitting before a god and a devil, respectively. They thrummed with strength that could rattle the whole universe, and the things they knew were very mysterious. It was like even the folds of their sleeves were jam-packed full of knowledge.
The alpha king was different, though. He was holding a gourd, and it looked as if he was smiling. He looked like an elderly neighbor who would sit outside the door smoking. He didn’t look like an all-powerful tyrant. Han Sen didn’t know if his mind was playing tricks on him, but Han Sen thought the old man’s eyes looked rather horny.
“This alpha king is very interesting,” Han Sen thought curiously. He carefully inspected the whole body, not willing to overlook a single part.
But no matter where he looked, Han Sen couldn’t discern anything meaningful from it. The statue had a spirit, but there was no sense of godly might. It was just very plain.
King Wen and King Bai’s statues elicited feelings that were scary to experience. Alpha king’s feelings were very weak by comparison. It was difficult to understand.
Han Sen sat in front of the statue for a whole day, but he was unable to learn a single thing. He frowned. He didn’t know if he should give up on the alpha king, as King Wen and King Bao had enticing amounts of power.
But Han Sen really cared about the gourd. He hesitated and stopped looking at the alpha king. He turned his attention to focus on the gourd instead.
Han Sen looked at it for a while, and he soon felt something weird.
Before, when Han Sen looked at a statue, he had focused on the king himself. The gourd was just an accessory, so there was nothing special to glean from looking at it.
But if he changed his perspective to center on the gourd as the primary aspect of the statue, then the king was actually the accessory, and things looked very different.
The children of the Extreme King were full of pride. They carried pride in every part of their lives, but it centered on their ancestors. They always showed them a great deal of respect. No one would even consider that the alpha king was just an accessory or a slave to the gourd.
Han Sen was an outsider. He wasn’t one of the Extreme King, so he didn’t share their thought processes. He really took the gourd seriously. He looked at it as if it was far more than a trinket, and by doing so, the entire statue took on a different meaning. It was as if he was stepping through a gate into a new world.
As Han Sen channeled his focus into the gourd instead of the king, his emotions changed entirely.
Realization slowly dawned on his face. The more he watched the gourd, the more familiar he thought it was. It looked like Bao’er before she was born.
“No way! The Extreme King alpha is holding a gourd, and the gourd is a statue of Bao’er before she was born?” Han Sen thought in complete shock.
Han Sen determined that the gourd was indeed Bao’er. The meaning of the gourd became clearer. A mysterious air began to spread, and it looked as if it was wrapping Han Sen up inside it.
“This gourd statue, it cannot be Bao’er who created it, surely.” Han Sen continued to stare at the statue, his expression cycling rapidly through emotions.
“Master, Bai Yi has entered the Pavilion,” Cher said with a bow to Bai Ling Shuang.
Bai Ling Shuang was seated on a sofa. Her beautiful legs were up, and she was holding a wine glass that she slowly twirled. Her expression changed to disdain, and she said, “Now that Bai Wuchang has used his pass, the Pavilion only has the statues of the alpha, the second king, and King Bao. The alpha and the second king’s statues have been there for billions of years, as no one has been able to understand them. And as for that King Bao, he was a strange king. Many royal children have tried to understand his statue, but they left empty-handed. There is no way Bai Yi will be able to understand anything about the statue.”
“Instead of asking for a reward that he could use more easily, Bai Yi insisted that he be given a Pavilion Pass. He does think a little too highly of himself,” Cher said.
Bai Ling Shuang’s lips tasted the wine. Then, she set the glass down. “In this world, the hardest thing isn’t understanding the enemy; it’s understanding yourself. Bai Yi isn’t the only person who struggles with that. Even with all the elites in our race, how many of them can truly claim to understand themselves? Bai Yi is just an ordinary man. It isn’t surprising that he asked for something beyond his capabilities. He won’t learn his limitations until he has tried it for himself.”
“You are correct, master. After all, there are not many people in this universe who are as insightful as you,” Cher gushed.
Bai Ling Shang looked at Cher and coldly said, “Your Fox tricks do not work on me.”
“I apologize,” Cher said immediately.
Bai Ling Shuang waved her hand, and she was about to respond when a look of shock crossed her face. She went to the balcony and looked up into the sky.
From another planet, a beam of light was shooting across the universe, casting shadows across entire planets.
“The Pavilion... That is impossible!” Bai Ling Shuang stared at the light in utter disbelief.
Every person of the Extreme King was in shock as they turned their heads up toward the beam of light coursing through the skies.
That light seemed born from powerful magic. As people looked at it, it seemed less like a king than a god or a devil. The scary presence was felt all over King’s Kingdom.
Under the gaze of all those royals in King’s Kingdom, the light moved. It started punching. It was the Extreme King’s most basic skill: Extreme King Punch.
The Extreme King’s geno arts were all derived from the Extreme King Punch. Even Bai Wei’s Extreme King Final Punch was an improved version of Extreme King Punch.
But this basic example of Extreme King Punch was shown through a shadow. It was hard to imagine how scary it was. Every punch seemed to hold enough power to break the universe.
As the nobles watched those punches, their hearts leaped in their chests. They were suppressed, and they found it difficult to breathe. It felt as if every punch they saw was going to cripple the whole universe, crushing them in the process.
Just watching that power coming from the punches was enough to put everyone in a daze. Those with weak wills found blood trickling from their noses and ears.
“This... our alpha... is it...?”
“Has someone claimed the alpha statue?”
“Who... who is this...?”
Almost everyone was wondering, especially the royal children. Even the nearby nobles were shocked.
It had been billions of years, and in all that time, no one had been able to claim it. The opening of that statue would shake the very foundation of their society.
No matter which prince or princess claimed the alpha statue, this was going to draw King Bai’s attention. If the royal child was already known to be incredibly talented, then this might be enough for them to usurp the place of the current crown prince.
After all, the crown prince wasn’t really very famous. The current crown prince had been selected only because he was the eldest son of the king. King Bai could boot that crown prince off his pedestal whenever he wanted to.
Bai Wei watched the alpha’s shadow of Extreme King Punch. She seemed to learn something as she stared. She followed what she saw in the sky and started to move, punch after punch. Her punches started off very complicated, but they became very simple. Her final punch became the most basic Shocking Sky Punch.
But her body was becoming stronger. It was becoming closer with the shadow of their alpha.
Katcha!
Some sort of lock inside Bai Wei appeared to have been broken. Her original body became an astral body, but the development didn’t end there. Following the alpha’s shadow punch, Bai Wei’s body continued to increase. She was fast going to have a celestial body.
This wasn’t just happening to Bai Wei, either. The whole of the Extreme King—every single person that practiced Shocking Sky Punch or something similar to it—began to gain strength because of that shadow. Many elites broke their boundaries, and even King class and deified sorts gained more power.
“So this is the power of our legendary alpha... He is so holy... Who did this? Who is the one that claimed the alpha statue?” Everyone was both shocked and exuberantly delighted by this turn of events, and they discussed rabidly between themselves.
The most likely candidate, they presumed, was Bai Wuchang. But he had already claimed a statue for himself. There was no way he would be allowed to go back to the Pavilion to grab another, so it couldn’t be him.
Others of royalty were powerful, too. No one could guess who it might have been.
Only Bai Ling Shuang’s expression was conflicted. She knew Bai Yi was in the Pavilion at that moment, but she was unable to fathom how Bai Yi, of all people, could have opened the alpha statue.
“It cannot be Bai Yi. There is probably some other royal child inside the Pavilion.” Bai Ling Shuang gritted her teeth as she spoke.
The light that came from the Pavilion began to fade, taking the alpha shadow with it. Many nobles and Extreme King elites looked towards the Pavilion. They wanted to know who had claimed the alpha statue.
King Bai was inside the palace, playing a game of chess. He held one of the pieces in his hand, forgotten, as he stared toward the Pavilion.
“Congratulations, my king, on having such a good son.” The person who was playing with King Bai smiled.
“Teacher, which prince do you think it is?” King Bai asked levelly, putting down a white chess piece.
It was the Extreme King’s National Teacher, known as Ancient Abyss, who was playing chess with him. The teacher looked like a forty-year-old man. He looked quite handsome with his little beard, but it did make him look older. Despite that, he looked quite dreamy and light.
Ancient Abyss bowed and said, “I do not know.”
King Bai didn’t ask any more questions. He looked in the direction of the Pavilion, waiting for the prince or princess that claimed the alpha king to emerge.
Han Sen, in the Extreme King’s Pavilion, was shocked. He’d only wanted a small reward for his efforts with the statue. He hadn’t intended to draw much attention, and now he frowned worriedly.
If he really was Bai Yi, he’d have been overjoyed. But he was only masquerading as Bai Yi, and now that he had caused so much of a disturbance, everyone was sure to turn their focus on him. His chances of being exposed were now incredibly high.
“What’s done is done, so there’s no point in worrying about it now. I’ll just take the item for now.” Han Sen looked at the space within the alpha statue. The opening had been revealed.
Through the opening was a square hole which held a wooden box around the size of a football. Han Sen pulled the box out, and the statue returned to how it had been when he first saw it.
Han Sen returned to sit in front of the statue. It didn’t have the sense of life that it had possessed before. It seemed that the statue really had become what it was supposed to be: a statue. There were no further hidden meanings to its existence, and the gourd in the statue’s hand didn’t summon that feeling of familiarity that it once had.
“The statue really can only be activated once.” Han Sen was looking at the wooden box. He thought to himself, “This is what the alpha of the Extreme King left behind. It cannot be anything lame, surely. It must be a deified weapon or something of the sort.”
The box wasn’t locked, and when Han Sen opened it up, he was given a shock.
The wooden box held a jade gourd about the size of Han Sen’s hand. It looked like a green crystal. The crystal seemed transparent, but Han Sen couldn’t see what was inside it.
“This jade gourd must have been carved. It isn’t a creature. Perhaps it’s a bottle shaped like a gourd?” Han Sen took the jade gourd out the box, but the gourd was entirely whole. There was no hole or seam that he could find.
Judging from the weight and feel, it didn’t seem hollow, though. It was made of solid jade.
Han Sen looked at the green gourd, and when he looked at its bottom, his fingers trembled. The bottom was flat, and a few words were carved on it.
“For the leader of Sacred only.” Han Sen was given a proper shock after reading those words.
As far as Han Sen knew, there was only one “leader of Sacred.” And this thing was from the Extreme King alpha. This couldn’t have been some nameless, meaningless item.
“Is the alpha of the Extreme King connected to the leader of Sacred? Otherwise, why would the Extreme King alpha have an item that belonged to the Sacred leader? Perhaps the Extreme King alpha received it sometime after the Sacred leader died. I still think they are related, though,” Han Sen thought to himself.
Han Sen turned the jade gourd over in his hands to study it. He couldn’t tell what it did.
“Whatever, I’ll just take it with me for now.” Han Sen put the jade gourd in his chest pocket. Then he picked up the wooden box and exited the Pavilion.
He knew many people would be watching the Pavilion, but he had no choice but to leave. He couldn’t stay there forever. He had to make an exit eventually.
Even though he had gone through a lot of things, in the face of something like this, even Han Sen was quite nervous. He couldn’t be certain of avoiding exposure now, with all the eyes watching him and his disguise of Bai Yi.
“Bai Yi! He is the one who...?” When Han Sen walked out of the Pavilion, all the Extreme King elites were surprised.
Many high level people knew that Bai Yi had used Return to Origin on Han Sen. The only people that didn’t know Bai Yi now looked like Han Sen were the few who didn’t read the news.
Even if they knew he was Bai Yi, though, they were still stunned. Even King Bai and Ancient Abyss were frightfully shocked. They hadn’t expected Bai Yi to have been the one to understand the statue.
“That is a rare occurrence, indeed,” King Bai said, as he watched. That was all he said, and no one knew exactly what he meant by the cryptic remark.
Ancient Abyss looked at Han Sen. Then, he turned back to King Bai. “How lucky. Congratulations, your majesty.”
“Luck has nothing to do with it,” King Bai said in a cool voice.
The other elites were even more shocked than King Bai. When Bai Wei looked at Han Sen, she felt a complex flurry of emotions.
Bai Ling Shuang’s face kept changing and twitching. When Miss Mirror looked at Han Sen, she frowned in thought.
Among the Extreme King, that day would be remembered for its stunning revelation. Prince Sixteen, Bai Yi, had claimed the alpha’s statue. It was like a miracle.
The alpha’s statue had been there for billions of years, and no one had been able to understand what was inside it. And Prince Sixteen, Bai Yi, who already had a bad reputation, had been the one to claim it. Everyone had their socks blown off.
When Han Sen rode the blood kirin back to Planet Water Zone, even the Princess Lan Haixin couldn’t help but stare at him from atop the palace.
Lan Haixin didn’t understand how Bai Yi had been able to claim the alpha king’s statue. She found it a very hard thing to believe.
Han Sen returned to his little building, closed the door, then started to play with his jade gourd. Aside from the words mentioning it was for the Sacred leader only, there was nothing else special about it. He couldn’t feel any special power residing inside it, despite searching it as thoroughly as he could.
Han Sen had a look at it with his Purple-Eye Butterfly, and there was nothing to witness. But, that did prove that the jade gourd was unusual.
“It is a shame Bao’er has gone undercover with Lan Haixin. It would be great if she was here. The statue’s gourd is so similar to Bao’er. Perhaps the jade gourd really is related to her,” Han Sen mused.
“Dad!” As Han Sen was lost in thought, Bao’er came jumping toward him, holding a variety of packages in her small arms.
“Bao’er, why are you back?” Han Sen was shocked. Bao’er was holding lots of food, and none of the goodies looked cheap. Her clothes were very pretty, too, and they obviously followed the fashion trends of the Siren.
“I missed you, Dad!” Bao’er leaped into Han Sen’s chest and rubbed her face against Han Sen’s.
“Dad missed Bao’er, too. But Bao’er, did Lan Haixin’s people see you coming?” Han Sen was hoping Bao’er had been able to get some information while he was away.
“Don’t worry. No one saw me.” Bao’er gave the food to Han Sen. “You must have been eating bad food while you were alone. Allow me to give you the good stuff.”
“Good good! You are so nice. You are the best daughter that a daddy could ask for.” Han Sen merrily accepted the food and started eating. Filled with curiosity, he handed Bao’er the jade gourd. “Bao’er, do you recognize what this is?”
Bao’er accepted the jade gourd and shook it. Then, she turned it upside-down. Something like water poured out of the jade gourd.
Han Sen was given another shock. He had thought the jade gourd was solid. He hadn’t realized that there was something hidden away inside.
The liquid that came out of the gourd looked like water, but it wasn’t. When the liquid came out, it didn’t flow out onto the floor. It floated in the air, and it looked like a floating fairy. Rather than dividing into droplets, the fairy held together in a single floating pool. It looked similar to Han Sen using the Original Water King Body.
“What is this? Han Sen was given another shock.
“Help Daddy to shower,” Bao’er directed the water fairy as she held the gourd.
The water fairy came over to Han Sen and stripped all his clothes off. Then she twirled her finger, and a water air wrapped around Han Sen’s entire body. It made him feel as if he was in the embrace of a natural spring.
The water fairy sat behind Han Sen and massaged his shoulders. Han Sen was definitely enjoying the massage, but he was disappointed and couldn’t help but say, “It’s just a servant?”
It had taken a lot of work for Han Sen to get into the Pavilion, and he had also risked exposure. It wasn’t worth it if he had only gotten a servant girl for his efforts.
Bao’er leaned her head to the side and said, “I don’t know, but I think that she has another function.”
“Can she fight?” Han Sen asked.
Bao’er lifted the gourd and pointed at the chair. She shouted, “Hit it!”
The water fairy went to the chair immediately, but her watery body broke as soon as she came into contact with it. The chair moved a little, but no actual lasting damage had been done.
“It looks as if she doesn’t.” Bao’er shook her head.
“This can’t be the servant of the Sacred leader. The Extreme King’s alpha surely wouldn’t be this lame, leaving behind such a weak item for his children.” Han Sen looked at the water fairy.
Bao’er asked the water fairy to give her a massage. The water fairy complied with the directive immediately, so it seemed as if she lacked a will of her own. It was a high class doll.
Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a better look at the water fairy, and what he saw shocked him. The water fairy’s body was an energy substance, and it was very tightly constructed. It seemed to contain a deified power, the likes of which Han Sen hadn’t seen before.
“Weird. Such strong power, but why doesn’t it deal any damage? What does this thing actually do?” Han Sen thought to himself as he looked at the water fairy.
Bao’er was having fun with it, at least. While the water fairy was rubbing her shoulders, Bao’er also instructed it to begin feeding her.
“Bao’er, how do I make use of this jade gourd?” Han Sen asked after a moment of thought. Perhaps using the gourd himself would let him investigate it further.
“It’s easy. Just put your energy into the gourd.” Bao’er handed it back to Han Sen.
After the gourd left Bao’er’s hand, the water fairy shattered and returned to the jade gourd like liquid.
Han Sen tried putting his power into the jade gourd, but he couldn’t make it work. Then he tried it again, and when he put his power inside it, the jade gourd worked. The water fairy bound itself to Han Sen’s will and emerged from the jade gourd.
“This thing is strange, but I really don’t know what she does.” Han Sen tried a few commands, making sure he was able to control the water fairy. Then, he put the jade gourd and the water fairy away.
“Bao’er, did you get any information from your time with Lan Haixin?” Han Sen asked Bao’er.
Bao’er nodded and said, “She and Bai Yi had a meeting arranged for the ninth of next month. They will be opening the relic, and she says Bai Yi has the genes of another race in him. But the genes aren’t complete. She says the chances that the relic will select Bai Yi are low. She thinks she will be able to control the relic.”
“Did she tell you what the relic might have been?” Han Sen asked further, pleased with the revelations.
“No.” Bao’er shook her head and swallowed some food.
“Good. Keep gathering all the information you can. Once you have found something, try to find a way to reach me,” Han Sen said with a smile.
“I promise I will do that.” Bao’er looked so serious, and she gave Han Sen a salute.
“Good. You are the pride of the people and the nation, and you are the pride of your daddy, too.” Han Sen convinced Bao’er to go back. Then, he got to thinking about what he himself might need to do.
The little red bird followed after Bao’er, but Han Sen didn’t worry about her.
Han Sen was most worried about the ramifications of the previous day. He hadn’t known that opening the alpha statue would cause so much trouble, and right now, the entire Extreme King society was still in the midst of dealing with their shock. Many eyes would be focused on him in the times to come.
“Considering Bai Yi’s pride and desire for attention, he wouldn’t maintain a low profile after suddenly becoming so famous. I need to go somewhere.” Han Sen got to thinking about where he should go.
Han Sen looked at the blood kirin, and then his eyes turned bright. “Yes! I should make the blood kirin register as my royal guard. Then, I can go to King’s Garden to steal a primary root king dragon. Only the princes and princesses are allowed to go to King’s Garden. No one there is deified. I still can’t reveal myself, but at least I won’t be left exposed to the people most likely to see through my disguise. And I can steal plenty of resources. Right, I should do that. I should go to King’s Garden.”
After Han Sen said that, he took the blood kirin with him and registered it as a royal guard. Then, he rushed to King’s Garden.
“My Prince, Bai Yi has left home. He took the blood kirin to register as a royal guard. And now, he is going to King’s Garden.”
“My Princess, Bai Yi took the blood kirin to King’s Garden.”
The same report was delivered to each and every palace. Many princes and princesses now raced to King’s Garden.
They wanted to know what was going on with Bai Yi. The idea that he had claimed the alpha’s statue was way too strange, and many royal children thought it was suspicious.
“He is out? I want to see if this is actually Bai Yi, or if it is really Han Sen.” Miss Mirror was holding a big mirror that reflected Han Sen’s movement inside King’s Garden. She paid special attention to the ring Han Sen was still wearing. Every few seconds, Miss Mirror would turn her eyes to glance at that ring. Then, she unconsciously touched the identical ring she wore on her own finger.
Han Sen had gone there with Bai Wei once, so he knew the way to go. He brought the blood kirin with him to King’s Garden.
Han Sen wasn’t fond of the bearded dragons, and he rode the blood kirin towards the king tree. He wanted to find one of those thick, primary root king dragons.
But as soon as the blood kirin started to move, a few shadows appeared before them. Han Sen examined them and realized it was a bunch of people he had never seen before.
He recognized some of them from the information Mister White had given him, however. The first one was Prince Swordstar. He was the forty-seventh royal child, and he was Bai Yi’s little brother. But he wasn’t from the same mother.
“Brother Forty-Seven, why are you blocking my way?” Han Sen asked, his expression gloomy.
Prince Swordstar smiled. He looked quite handsome as he said, “I am here to congratulate you, Brother Sixteen, on acquiring an understanding of the Extreme King alpha. And I am curious what the Extreme King alpha left behind in the Pavilion. I hope you will be able to tell me.”
“And what if I don’t tell you?” Han Sen asked with a chuckle.
“Then this little brother is going to have to teach you a lesson,” Prince Swordstar said coldly.
“Ha! You aren’t worthy of challenging me. Beat my guard first,” Han Sen replied haughtily.
The blood kirin roared. A red mist covered its body, exerting intense pressure on the surrounding area. A blood shadow came right for Prince Swordstar.
“You aren’t the only one who has a guard.” Prince Swordstar’s face didn’t change. Without a command, his own guard leaped out to fight the blood kirin.
King class was divided into nine different tiers. Becoming half-deified required a person to break through all nine tiers. A further barrier had to be surpassed before someone could become fully deified.
Instead of being recognized separately, these nine tiers were typically just grouped under King class, however. The power of a King’s area-of-effect grew with each tier that was surpassed.
The blood kirin had completed all nine tiers; it was half-deified, after all. Prince Swordstar’s guard was a half-deified elite, too.
“How dare you behave so poorly in front of a prince!” That half-deified guard made a cow’s mooing sound. He then released a yellow king area, which overlapped with the blood kirin’s blood area. The guard lifted the axe in his hand and ran forward to strike the blood kirin.
The blood area combined with the yellow area, and both guards were affected by each other. A sudden weight fell across the blood kirin’s body, as if it had suddenly shouldered the weight of a mountain.
The yellow area was associated with the element of earth, and it created earth elemental pressure within its zone. Kings with poor bodies could very well find themselves crushed by that pressure.
As the blood kirin was pressed down by the earth power, the guard’s axe came towards the creature like a mountain. It was aimed to come down on the blood kirin’s head. The power exerted would have been enough to cut an entire planet in half.
Roar!
The blood kirin roared. Instead of trying to avoid the strike, it used its own horn to block the falling axe.
Boom!
The blood and yellow powers surged against each other. The blood kirin’s horn was able to block the big axe, keeping the axe aloft.
The half-deified guard roared. He struggled to push his big axe down further, as the two powers kept crashing against each other in the area.
Han Sen and Prince Swordstar watched the two from afar. Suddenly, a massive red and yellow explosion rocked the area. The blood kirin was able to get past the half-deified guard.
When the light of the explosion faded and the onlookers could see again, they immediately noticed that the blood kirin’s neck scales were torn. There was a huge cleft across them, and the blood kirin’s blood began to drip slowly down its chest.
The chestplate of the half-deified guard’s armor had also been broken. He had been cut, and he was bleeding, as well.
“Very strong body! You did not die after taking a blow from my Open Sky Axe, but still, you will die today,” the half-deified guard shouted fiercely. His Open Sky Axe produced a scary light, and it came swinging at the blood kirin again.
The blood kirin lowered its head. Its eyes looked red. Then the eyes grew darker and darker, until they ended up looking black.
Han Sen understood the blood kirin well, and he knew now that it was really angry. Its blood air was about to go mad. It was like a nuclear bomb that was on the verge of detonating.
As the half-deified guard sprang toward it, the blood kirin did not dodge. It raised its head and peered at the guard. The blood air in its eyes was about to erupt like a volcano.
Blergh!
The power from the blood kirin’s eyes didn’t explode out as Han Sen had expected. The other guard’s chest suddenly started to rupture with blood.
His Open Sky Axe didn’t come down as planned. Blood spurted from his wound like a spring, and everyone watching the fight looked on in shock. The half-deified guard quickly tried to cast a power to stop his loss of blood.
But it was a futile effort. Blood still streamed out of his chest, then turned into a mist and drifted straight over to the blood kirin, where the blood kirin promptly absorbed it.
The wound on the blood kirin’s neck soon closed up as if it had never existed.
The blood kirin roared like a lion. It became a blood shadow, then flew over to the half-deified guard.
The half-deified guard was bleeding, and his face looked shocked at the turn of events. He roared in response and swung his Open Sky Axe at the blood kirin once more, desperately trying to slash the incoming blood kirin.
The blood kirin made no attempt to evade the big axe, and neither did it try to use its claws to block the blow. The beast allowed the axe to slam into it and cut a deep crevice across its scales. At the same time, though, the blood kirin’s talons touched down on its opponent.
As the guard screamed, his blood sprayed like a geyser.
The murderous blood kirin ignored the frantic blows of the axe, using its scales to absorb the strikes as its claws continued shredding the guard’s armor and tearing up his flesh.
The blood kirin’s claws left marks all across the knight, and blood spilled ceaselessly from his body. His blood was like a volcano, and nothing could stop that eruption.
Han Sen grinned as he watched. The blood kirin’s blood area was a very scary ability. Han Sen was fortunate that the blood kirin was not his enemy.
Instead, when the guard hit the blood kirin with the big axe, it was now able to heal so quickly.
After a moment, the half-deified guard was broken. He screamed continuously as he tried to scramble away, but under the grip of the blood kirin’s blood area, he had lost too much blood. His powers were now weak, and he no longer had the strength to run.
The blood kirin was like a wolf. It was like a tiger. It leaped over towards the man, then ripped off his arms and swallowed them. Crunching noises came from the creature as it savored its snack.
“Prince! Save... save me!” the half-deified screamed to Prince Swordstar.
Prince Swordstar felt a bitter chill strike him after watching all this. The cruelty of the blood kirin shocked him and all the other guards.
Before Prince Swordstar could say anything, the blood kirin picked up the guard in its mouth and ate him whole.
A half-deified elite had been completely swallowed by the blood kirin. The man’s last scream still echoed in the ears of the horrified audience.
“Bai Yi... You killed my guard...” Prince Swordstar looked very ill. His eyes stared blankly ahead.
“It was just a guard, and he died. What’s the big deal? If you are not happy about it, the blood kirin is willing to hear your complaints. Go and kill it, if you dare,” Han Sen replied flatly.
“You...” Prince Swordstar’s face had darkened. He wasn’t half-deified. He only had two half-deified guards in his employ, and now one of them had been eaten by the blood kirin. Sending another one into the fray would not help.
Other princes and princesses watched the fight from afar, looking jealously at the blood kirin.
“I didn’t expect that Han Sen’s xenogeneic would be so strong; it is like it is deified already! I cannot believe that *sshole Bai Yi was able to claim it.” When Bai Ling Shuang saw the blood kirin’s performance, the sight made her grumble angrily.
“If you have nothing else to say, Brother Forty-Seven, then I best be on my way.” Han Sen mounted the blood kirin again and looked at Prince Swordstar with disdain. Then he headed towards the king tree.
Prince Swordstar’s face kept cycling through a number of emotions, but he let Han Sen go and did not press for another fight.
Prince Swordstar wasn’t willing to continue the contest, but Bai Ling Shuang and the other royal children still followed Han Sen. They could see he was getting close to the king tree.
“Is he going to practice in front of the king tree?” Bai Ling Shang frowned, her expression turning strange.
Han Sen thought he would find more primary root king dragons closer to the tree, but that wasn’t the case. The ground closest to the king tree was different, and normal royal children wouldn’t dare to approach it. That was why Bai Ling Shuang looked so disturbed.
</p>
  <p>Ch 2335-2350
Prince Swordstar stared furiously at Han Sen’s back. “Let’s go.”
“Prince, you are just going to leave like this?” Prince Swordstar’s remaining guard looked angry as he spoke.
Prince Swordstar said coldly, “My people will not die for nothing. He dared to kill in King’s Garden, and so the blood kirin will die. Let’s go to the sentencing court.”
Han Sen rode the blood kirin to the king tree. In his heart, he was thinking, “The blood kirin’s desire to kill is way too strong. If he wants to kill, there is nothing I can do to stop him. Fortunately, it was only a guard. I can negotiate and explain his actions.”
As he got closer and closer to the king tree, Han Sen was unable to find any primary root king dragons. Han Sen kept moving forward.
The primary root king dragons appeared in different locations each and every time. Han Sen was not lucky today, though. He didn’t run into any of them on his way.
There were many princes and princesses following him, however. Han Sen mostly ignored their presence, but after a while, he noticed that they had fallen back and stopped following him forward. That was a little concerning.
Han Sen looked around and found that he was close to the king tree. It was so thick, like a giant pillar in front of him. There were one hundred miles of land between him and the tree.
Han Sen could see that there were some wrinkles in the tree’s bark that were as wide as entire valleys. But the king dragons he had seen were not as big as that.
Han Sen slowed down the speed of his approach. This place was quite different than he had imagined. Getting closer to the tree didn’t result in him finding more and more of the primary root king dragons.
Han Sen soon found a king dragon, with a man in a white robe standing before it. Han Sen remembered the information given to him by Mister White, and he quickly recognized the man.
Prince Seventeen, Bai Qing Xia, was known as the prettiest man in the entirety of King’s Kingdom.
The man was so handsome that his good looks made him practically invincible.
While Qing Xia was very handsome, the legends also said that he was quite weak. His mother had been injured while she was pregnant, and her baby had been injured as well. So, he was born damaged. He was a very weak person among the Extreme King, and his body wasn’t like one of the royal bloodline. He was weaker than a commoner.
Prince Qing Xia was very handsome, but he wasn’t good at anything except for being eye candy. He didn’t join the fights for authority. If anyone mentioned him in conversation, it was just to talk about his face.
“Brother Seventeen, what are you doing?” Han Sen rode the blood kirin over to Prince Qing Xia, but the man didn’t respond. Han Sen wanted to know why Prince Seventeen was the only one there, though; all the other royal children were gone.
Prince Qing Xia’s eyes were like stars, and his facial features were sharp. He was like a carving, wrought from a block of marble. But he didn’t look good. In fact, he looked pale and sick.
He hadn’t expected Han Sen to approach and talk to him. Prince Qing Xia looked at Han Sen and said, “I am here to get protection from King Wen. Aren’t you doing the same, Brother Sixteen?”
“Um... I’m just walking around.” Han Sen didn’t think he had come at the right time. He didn’t know what “protection from King Wen” meant.
“Maybe it is something connected to the Kingese scrawl upon the king leaves, but how will that help him? Is he going to pick a leaf off the king tree?” Han Sen thought to himself.
Prince Qing Xia smiled and said, “There is no need to hide since you are here now. If you are strong enough to claim the alpha’s statue, then of course you can gain the protection of King’s Cover.”
“If you want the Kingese, then I should not disturb you. I will continue walking around,” Han Sen said, then readied himself to depart.
He hadn’t figured out how to get the Kingese, and if he wasn’t careful, he could risk being exposed. He had to get out of there now and figure out the Kingese later.
Prince Qing Xia suddenly jumped. His body teleported in front of Han Sen, barring his departure.
“The Kingese hasn’t woken up yet. I am curious how you were able to understand the alpha’s statue. Please teach me, Brother Sixteen,” Prince Qing Xia said. Before Han Sen agreed, he threw a slap at Han Sen.
His fingers were long, and they glowed with light. It was a pretty sight, but somehow, it was still masculine at the same time.
Han Sen saw his slap and noticed how light it was, and how there was no power. But even so, the move felt as if it would be very difficult to predict. Han Sen was shocked by it.
“People say Prince Qing Xia is quite weak, and it would be difficult for him to evolve. But now, I do not think those claims are true. His slap is something very special,” Han Sen frowned.
The blood kirin sat down and roared. It wanted to jump away, but Han Sen prevented it from doing so.
There was a rule in the King’s Garden that forbade killing. It was intended to protect princes and princesses only, though. There were options if a guard was killed, but killing a prince wouldn’t just lead to the blood kirin being punished; Han Sen would be, too.
After stopping the blood kirin, Han Sen leaped off of the blood kirin’s back and punched towards Prince Qing Xia.
His fist flew forward in the traditional Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch. He had learned it from the alpha statue. The rest of the Extreme King had only seen the shadow, but Han Sen had watched the alpha statue actually perform the skill.
Pang!
The fist and the palm came against each other. Han Sen and Prince Qing Xia felt their bodies vibrate as they were pushed back. Neither of them gained the upper-hand.
Han Sen’s punch included the Original Water King Body power. Although it was only on the first tier of area powers, it was still quite strong, and Prince Qing Xia could fight against Han Sen as an equal. It seemed as if the rumors of the Prince’s weakened body were not quite accurate.
“Extreme King really does have many elites. I can never underestimate anyone.” Han Sen was shocked.
Many princes and princesses were watching from a distance, and they found themselves surprised again.
Bai Yi was well-known for being quite reckless and exceptionally greedy. Bai Qing Xia was known for being very weak and sick. For two princes like that to fight under the king tree was quite weird.
It might have been an understandable conflict if it took place somewhere else, but the king tree was only a hundred miles away. Both princes were beneath the King’s Cover. Even geniuses like Bai Wuchang and Bai Ling Shuang wouldn’t enter that place. And those two princes had.
The King’s Cover wasn’t a dangerous place, but it had the king tree’s king air blessing. If the king tree gave them its approval, they would earn its protection. They’d be protected by the Kingese.
If they were not approved, then they would simply stand there and nothing would happen.
Many princes and princesses hoped to earn the protection of the Kingese, but amidst their uncertainty, none wished to try. If they didn’t earn the protection of King’s Cover or have much Kingese, they would be laughed at for being unlucky.
If a prince didn’t even have the blessing from the Kingese on the king tree, people would believe him to be very unfortunate. They would think the prince was plagued by bad luck. Such a person could never lead the Extreme King and rule the known world.
Although the protection of the Kingese didn’t accurately represent the luck of a prince, it still affected the way they were perceived by others. Thus, the royal children wouldn’t seek the protection of the Kingese on a random whim.
In the era of King Bao’s reign, there was a much-loved prince. He was very intelligent and a sublime fighter. King Bao was extremely fond of him, and many nobles believed that the prince would be the one to take the throne and succeed King Bao.
Even the prince himself believed he would be the one. He thought he was a man that was blessed with great fortune and luck. So, he went to King’s Cover to test the mettle of his beliefs. But he did not get the Kingese. After that transpired, King Bao’s love turned sour. He didn’t allow the prince to succeed him, and instead passed the mantle onto the man now known as King Bai.
The prince didn’t lose the throne solely due to the lack of Kingese protection, but it was one of the primary factors involved.
Similar things transpired in every era of the Extreme King, just to varying degrees.
The royal children that wanted to take the throne wouldn’t dare risk being rejected by the King’s Cover; it was the royal children that were not ambitious that were more willing to try. A rejection wouldn’t affect them as much.
A royal child who got the blessing of five Kingese would be deemed a lucky person. Getting the blessing of nine Kingese meant a person was super lucky. Getting more than nine was something most kingly, and it was also absurdly rare.
But even getting the protection of more than nine Kingese didn’t guarantee a chance at the throne. So, the Kingese’s protection didn’t mean everything.
Luckily, the Kingese itself was useful. It was good to have, so the more the better.
Bai Qing Xia moved like a cloud, coming for Han Sen.
Han Sen grunted in annoyance. After he used the Extreme King’s Shocking Sky Punch to counter Bai Qing Xia’s palm, the fight continued.
Because they were too close to the king tree, the last thing they wanted to do was hurt it, so they held their powers and fought with raw strength.
“Huh? Prince Qing Xia has great palm skills. That must be King Seventh’s Hatred Times Ten.” A Prince blurted as he looked at Bai Qing Xia.

“It really is Hatred Times Ten. Times One is one area, while Times Ten is half-deified. I cannot believe Bai Qing Xia learned this. He just became King class, did he not? He only has Times One area power. His Hatred Times Ten is only at its first tier,” another prince commented.
“But Bai Qing Xia is weak. It is surprising that he is able to learn such a powerful geno art at all,” another prince remarked.
Bai Ling Shuang watched Bai Qing Xia and frowned. “Bai Qing Xia hid his abilities this well? It looks as if he has come here to seek out the protection of King’s Cover. That is an unusual choice. We have clearly been underestimating him. His heart must be far more complicated than most of the princes that can harness strong power.”
Miss Mirror saw Bai Qing Xia’s Hatred Times Ten and looked on with interest. She said, “This pretty prince has practiced Hatred Times Ten. And on top of that, it isn’t just at the first tier. This is really interesting.”
After pausing, Miss Mirror laughed and said, “Good! Let’s see how he does against Han Sen.”
Han Sen used his Extreme King Shocking Sky Punch to fight against Bai Qing Xia. Han Sen was surprised as they fought. That pretty man’s fighting power far exceeded his expectations.
The man’s hands moved fluidly, and they didn’t look very strong. But even so, they gave off a palpable sensation of evil. Han Sen could feel this very clearly, and if he was careless, taking just half of one hit could deplete him of half of his life.
“Weird. Why does Old Sixteen only use the Shocking Sky Punch? Does he only know this one skill?” Prince Nineteen looked on and frowned.
Prince Nineteen stood beside Prince Fourteen Bai Canglang. Bai Canglang laughed darkly and said, “Old Sixteen is deliberately insulting Seventeen. He wants to use Shocking Sky Punch to beat Hatred Times Ten. His arrogant personality clearly hasn’t changed a bit. Luckily, Seventeen has the first tier of King area. If he didn’t, he would have been killed by now.”
“I don’t know how a guy like him was able to claim the alpha statue,” Prince Nineteen said with a lift of his lips.
“Everyone is bound to have some good luck at some point.” Bai Canglang looked at Han Sen with scorn.
Bai Qing Xia noticed that no matter how much he altered his palm skills, Han Sen was still only using Shocking Sky Punch. He concluded that Han Sen was insulting him on purpose, and his pretty face reddened with anger.
Suddenly, Bai Qing Xia changed his palm skills. The weak-looking palm skills became a laser that could pierce through the universe. And now, one of those strikes was headed for Han Sen.
The blow was too fast, and no one should have been able to react to it.
“Love too much and you become hateful... That is the second tier of Hatred Times Ten! How is that possible? Bai Qing Xia is just a first-tier King! How could he now have Hatred Times Two?” Prince Nineteen looked shocked.
Bai Canglang’s face changed, as well. He looked to be just as stunned.
Many other princes and princesses stared mutely at the fight. Bai Ling Shuang frowned. “I suppose we must say goodbye to the old Qing Xia. He has used his first-tier body to hold Hatred Times Two. It must have taken incredible cunning to hide away all this power within a body that we all thought was sickened and weak.”
Han Sen didn’t move. He threw another Shocking Sky Punch, and his fist came against the sharp, opposing light.
Pang!
The scary presence exploded. That laser light was crushed by Han Sen’s fist and rendered harmless.
“That was a perfect Shocking Sky Punch. No wonder Brother Sixteen claimed the alpha statue,” Bai Qing Xia thought, maintaining his calm. He flipped his hand, and this time, it went from fast to slow. It was like he was slowly pushing a mountain towards Han Sen.
“One palm to sunder the day and night cycle... It is Hatred Times Three!” A prince was shocked.
Bai Qing Xia had been known as the Sick Beauty. Everyone had believed, for years and years, that he was weak. But suddenly, he was exploding with so much power and talent.
Hatred Times Ten was super hard to practice, and it required a massive amount of talent. Not many royal children could practice it, so it was a very stunning revelation that Bai Qing Xia had learned the skill. Now, his first-tier body could make Hatred Times Three’s palm split the day and night cycle. How could people not be surprised by this?
“Scary talent. Very deep mind.” All the royal children’s eyes changed as they looked at Bai Qing Xia. They once looked at him with pity and disgust, but no longer.
Chapter 2337 Kingese
Seeing Bai Qing Xia striking with his palm, Han Sen unleashed another Shocking Sky Punch.
He would have liked to use other techniques, but he had only just started using his Bai Yi disguise. He hadn’t yet had the time to learn any other skills. He had been lucky to learn this punch from the Extreme King alpha’s statue, but using other skills might expose him.
The Shocking Sky Punch was a technique that every member of the Extreme King had to learn. Although it was basic, it was still very powerful. It would be ridiculous to call the skill invincible, but it could challenge a surprising number of other techniques.
Pang!
The fist and the palm hit each other. Han Sen’s Shocking Sky Punch blocked Bai Qing Xia’s day and night cycle split. But still, no one was winning.
“Huh. Bai Yi’s Shocking Sky Punch managed to block the day and night cycle split? Today is a weird day. We are witnessing so many bizarre things.”
“They are both first-tier Kings. How can a Shocking Sky Punch break a day and night cycle split?”
“The Bai family has too many powerful members. Those two princes have never really revealed themselves before. I wouldn’t have expected the two to possess powers like this. They are both so talented, and it seems as if the fight between these two princes has only just begun.”
...
Everyone was talking. Instead of attacking Han Sen again, Bai Qing Xia just stared at his opponent. A long time later, he said, “You are very special, Brother Sixteen. It was no wonder that you were able to claim the alpha statue.”
“You’re not bad, either,” Han Sen admitted with a nod.
Bai Qing Xia raised his head. He looked up to the king tree and said, “The king tree is going to wake up, so we should cease our fighting for now. If you are here to seek protection from King’s Cover, then let us determine a victory through how many Kingese we both receive. How does that sound?”
“I’m just here on a stroll. I don’t care if I get Kingese or not,” Han Sen said.
Bai Qing Xia laughed. “Are you afraid to lose?”










“Huh? You really think I can actually be afraid of you?” Han Sen grunted dismissively.
“Then it is settled. We will determine the victor based on how many Kingese we each receive. Whoever has the most Kingese will win.” After saying this, Bai Qing Xia returned to the king dragon’s head.
Han Sen had no idea how to get the Kingese. So, he pretended to shoot Bai Qing Xia a look of contempt. He flew to another king dragon’s head and sat down just like the other prince.
Seeing Bai Qing Xia close his eyes atop the dragon’s head, Han Sen pretended to do the same. The blood kirin sat down next to him.
“Bai Qing Xia and Bai Yi are both seeking King Cover’s protection. I wonder how many Kingese they will receive?”
“In the past, I would have thought they would be lucky to earn one or two. But now, it is hard to tell. Those two have been keeping secrets, and it is obvious they are looking to impress everyone. They’re probably still hiding much of their power.”
“You are right. I didn’t expect two normal princes to hide their powers in the way they have. It looks like this is the Extreme King’s strongest era.”
“Haha! As the royal children grow stronger, their fights will grow stronger as well. I do not know if that is good or bad.”
The king tree’s leaves started to glow, but few of the royal children went looking for the primary root king dragons. Most of them wanted to watch Han Sen and Bai Qing Xia.
Every leaf on the king tree had some Kingese. When the king tree woke up, the Kingese on the leaves grew brighter. Under their light, the leaves looked gold.
Kingese was the blood pulse of the leaves. Every king leaf’s blood pulse was different. As time passed, the blood pulse became brighter. The Kingese brightened into gold symbols branded onto the gold leaves, and each symbol gave off a different sensation.
Some of them were strong like fire. Some of them felt like rushing water. Some of them were heavy on the ground, and others were deep like an abyss.
Although Han Sen couldn’t decipher the Kingese, he could feel their power. He could understand what they meant.
It wasn’t because Han Sen was good at learning. It was because the power of each Kingese was linked to a substance. There was a deeper meaning to them than a mere hieroglyph. Han Sen didn’t have to learn them. He just had to see the shape of the item that was related to the Kingese. Then, he could recognize what they meant.
“This world is so big. Everything and anything can exist here. Even the leaves of the king tree are in some way connected to the fabric of the world. It’s all-inclusive. How amazing.” Han Sen sighed, and then he thought to himself, “If I could dig it out and haul it back to the Alliance, I wonder if it would still grow?”
The king tree and its leaves woke up. The Kingese was shining brightly. A king dragon nearby roared and then fell into the ground.
Han Sen saw that Bai Qing Xia hadn’t moved yet. He furrowed his eyebrows. “Does he not want the protection of the Kingese? Why is he sitting on the head of a dragon? That way, he will not be able to go underground.”
That was what Han Sen was thinking, at least. He didn’t move. He maintained his position just as Bai Qing Xia did, sitting atop the dragon head.
The king dragons around them were all drilling into the soil. And then, both of their own king dragons started to move. Bai Qing Xia still didn’t move.
Han Sen wasn’t sure what was going on. The king dragon didn’t go underground as the other dragons did. Instead, it raised its head and went up to the top of the tree.
The boughs of the tree high above were like a golden sky. The Kingese was shining like a platter of gold stars. The two dragons kept going up and up, as if they were shooting off into the cosmos.
If someone hadn’t actually seen it in person, it would have been difficult to imagine how beautiful it looked.
Han Sen was standing atop the dragon’s head, staring at the shining Kingese. It was like he was in a dreamland.
Those two king dragons stopped moving forward after reaching the halfway point. After all, they were just the roots of the king tree, and there was only so far that they could go. They would have to disconnect from the king tree to go further.
Bai Qing Xia opened his eyes. He stood up, looked at the Kingese, and said, “The older one should do this first, so go ahead.”
“I am just sight-seeing. You go first,” Han Sen said simply.

He had no idea how to gain the approval and protection of the Kingese.
Bai Qing Xia didn’t decline the offer to go first. He looked up to the Kingese, and then his body started to glow with a white light. The white became more intense, and it made Bai Qing Xia’s body brighter. It was like he was becoming a transparent jade stone.
“King body?” Han Sen squinted. Bai Qing Xia was still standing on his dragon’s head. His body was so bright, it was like he was wholly wrapped-up by a godlight. It wasn’t just his flesh, either; even his hair looked like jade.
With his king body’s power spreading, the Kingese on the king leaves answered. A king leaf started to shake. It began to make a rustling noise, like it was caught in a wind that affected nothing else.
Chapter 2338 Bai Qing Xia’s Words
“Ah, so opening the king body can attract the Kingese. I thought this was something special,” Han Sen thought to himself.
As he mulled this over, one leaf suddenly stood out among the galaxy of shining Kingese. The Kingese upon it was shining brighter than the sun.
Before Han Sen had even started focusing, the Kingese left the leaf and went straight for Bai Qing Xia.
Among the people that were watching the sight from afar, someone started screaming in excitement. “It moved! The Kingese moved! What is that word?”
Many of the royal children looked over to see what the voice was talking about. The Kingese that was shining like a sun seemed to be transparent and natural in its form. It was like looking at a beautifully polished piece of jade.
“Fan!” Bai Ling Shuang read the word out loud.
“Fan, or pretty gem... Even the king tree things Prince Seventeen is pretty like a gem. He is a shiny thing himself, and so that is why Fan came down for him,” Bang Canglang said coolly.
The word Fan was shining, and it landed on Bai Qing Xia’s forehead. It melted into his flesh like a snowflake touching water.
When that Kingese symbol blended into the man, Bai Qing Xia’s attractive body looked even shinier. His skin was like the spotless surface of a beautiful jade. Any pale spots on his body seemed to have vanished, and he looked to have been rejuvenated. He looked very handsome.
Many of the princesses were so jealous that it drove them a little crazy. They wanted the word Fan, too. They would rather have that than any of the other Kingese.
“Hmph, he is just a pretty boy,” Prince Nineteen scoffed. His eyes were betraying his true feelings, however.
“He is so pretty. He has everything.” A female guard sighed at the sight. She couldn’t peel her eyes away from Bai Qing Xia’s face.
When Fan was totally blended into Bai Qing Xia’s body, another king leaf erupted with a bountiful light. The second symbol flew down, headed for Bai Qing Xia’s forehead once more.
Han Sen looked at the Kingese. The Kingese was shining, but it wasn’t very bright. It was very small, and it would likely bring comfort and calm to those trapped in a storm.








“Yin!” Han Sen had never seen the symbol before, but he could read and understand what it meant.
Bai Qing Xia saw the Yin drifting into his body. His jade-like light vanished. He looked like someone from heaven that had fallen down to earth to become nothing more than a commoner.
Looking at him more closely would lead to a very different conclusion, however. It was like there was jade hidden among piles of sand. There was a light, just waiting to emerge.
When it was truly unearthed, he would look so pretty.
“Yin is fitting for him. Bai Qing Xia remained hidden for many years, and then, he started to impress people today. He deserves to have the word Yin.” Bai Ling Shuang sighed. “It looks like we have another to compete against.”
As the hidden word settled, another Kingese symbol fell from a king leaf. The next word was like fire, and it moved fiercely along its path. It seemed like it could ignore everything in the world.
“Ao.” Han Sen read the word out.
Prince Nineteen grated out a laugh. “Sick Beauty was hidden for many years. Even when people humiliated him and made fun of him, he never said a word. He has always been little more than a turtle. Does he really deserve the word Ao? I’m beginning to doubt the tree’s infallible ability to sense the truth.”
“Ao doesn’t mean crazy. Crazy is something on the surface, whereas Ao resides in the bones. This Ao is in the bone and the heart. Bai Qing Xia has been humiliated a lot over the years, but he never gave up his desire to win. He has kept going and going up until now, so he definitely deserves Ao,” Bai Canglang said, shaking his head.
Prince Nineteen snorted. “Fan, Yin, and Ao. That isn’t bad. But that combination has no connection to the qualities of a king. It is nothing like Tian, De, Jun, Qin, or Shi. And it most certainly cannot compare with Ren, Yi, Li, Xin, Zhi, Zhong, Xiao Ti. Those three words aren’t very useful, and I highly doubt Father will approve of them.”
Bai Canglang looked at Prince Nineteen, but he didn’t say anything in response. His face showed his silent disagreement.
The Ao landed atop Bai Qing Xia’s head, and it combined with his body. It changed his body, giving him more of that overbearing power.
Han Sen looked at him with much interest, and he thought to himself, “These Kingese symbols are quite powerful. They can change your genes and alter your body and senses. They can even affect your will. That’s really quite amazing. If I can get a symbol associated with fire, my proficiency with the elements of fire will be much improved. Every word would certainly be useful, and the more words the better.”
Han Sen’s next thought made him rather depressed, however. The words the king tree dropped were dependent on the king body that would receive them. Han Sen had stolen Bai Yi’s Original Water King Body. If he used that body to gain Kingese, he would probably get the element of water. And Han Sen wasn’t really interested in water. He was hoping to get Fan, or at least some word that would make him look more handsome.
But the king tree dropped what it wanted to drop. It always depended on how the king tree felt. People could do nothing to change it.
After Ao, another symbol fell down. That word was full of hatred, which Han Sen could tell before he even saw it properly. Merely feeling the hate surrounding it was enough to know that it would bear the word Hen.
Seeing this word, the royal children looked quite interested.
“Intriguing. Bai Qing Xia has hatred in his heart. Who does he hate, I wonder? Does he hate the lack of fairness or the people that used to bully him, perhaps? Or the high-class people above him?” Miss Mirror saw Hen, and she smiled. She looked very interested in that.
After the hatred of Hen, another word started to descend. It was called Shan. That was surprising. No matter what strength Bai Qing Xia was hiding, he didn’t sound anything like a strong mountain.
The Kingese symbols continued to fall, and there had been eight words already. The king tree still hadn’t stopped. More Kingese came down, falling through the leaves.
“This is the ninth word. This Bai Qing Xia is on the verge of shocking everyone.” All the princes and princesses looked on with wide eyes. No matter what that ninth word would be, it proved that Bai Qing Xia was talented.
If the ninth word was just some horrible Kingese, then it proved he was an evil individual. He couldn’t be a leader if that was the case.
After the ninth word combined with Bai Qing Xia, another king leaf lit up like a sun.
“The tenth word... There have been ten words!” Everyone was shocked. Gaining the king tree’s approval nine times was already a glorious thing, but now, Bai Qing Xia was on the verge of getting ten words. This was extremely rare to see in the Extreme King. Everyone looked at Bai Qing Xia differently now.
Chapter 2339 Begging for Kingese
“Ah, how interesting.” Miss Mirror leaned closer to her mirror as the next symbol fell.
Han Sen was confused. He had thought that the king tree was giving out words that would improve Bai Qing Xia’s genes, but seeing this, there was a possibility that he had misunderstood.
When the word meaning Evil went into him, Bai Qing Xia’s body started to look evil. It completely went against his style.
“It looks like the king tree only detects what is special about Bai Qing Xia. Whether the thing hidden inside him is good or bad, the tree makes it stronger. And even flaws can be strengthened.” Han Sen now understood how the king tree distributed its words.
Seeing the word Evil appear, the royal children didn’t show much of a reaction. Many of the royal children had received the same symbol, and even so, they were able to become king. So, it didn’t matter.
After the word Evil blended into the man, the leaves of the king tree remained lit. Another Kingese symbol drifted down from the king tree. It was headed for Bai Qing Xia’s forehead once more.
Seeing that word, Bai Ling Shuang screamed and said, “Ni!”
Bai Ling Shuang wasn’t the only person having such a reaction. Even Miss Mirror, using her mirror to watch the events, stood up. Her eyes opened up wide, looking at the word Betrayal.
That word Ni didn’t have a thunderous presence or a shocking atmosphere. It barely glowed. The small light it had looked as if it would be extinguished any second.
But that word made every prince and princess scream. They weren’t shocked that Bai Qing Xia had obtained eleven Kingese; they were merely shocked by the word Betrayal.
There were countless Kingese symbols. The number of words that descended tended to show the talent of the person obtaining them. But different Kingese symbols meant different things.
It was impossible to say which words were good and which ones were bad. But some words across history had been known to prove how great an individual was.
One such example was the word Betrayal. The second king of the Extreme King, King Wen, had received the word Betrayal.
That was the only word he received. Compared to all those other royals, he was at the bottom of the list. But King Wen beat out all the other talented royal children to become the second king of the Extreme King. He also became one of the most famous kings in their history.


































Back then, there was a rare prince that managed to receive twenty-one words. But he lost to King Wen, who only had one word.
After King Wen, there were seventy more kings, and countless princes and princesses. But no one else had received the word Betrayal.
Right now, Bai Qing Xia had received the word Betrayal, which shook the royal children. That word made it clear that Bai Qing Xia was indeed a very special person. This was in addition to the ten words he had received before.
Everyone was so shocked. Their mouths were opened wide, looking at Bai Qing Xia in utter shock. They couldn’t even speak.
“He was so quiet at one point, but now he is suddenly shocking everyone. Prince Seventeen will be famous all around the universe.” One of the guards sighed.
After the word Betrayal appeared, there were no more Kingese symbols. Bai Qing Xia’s power went dim. He released his king body and told Han Sen, “Brother Sixteen! I received eleven words, so it is now your turn.”
“What is your king body’s name?” Han Sen gave the man a haughty look. He knew what it was, but he pretended he didn’t.
“Genzo King Body,” Bai Qing Xia said calmly. He didn’t rise to Han Sen’s provocation.
“Your Genzo King Body isn’t too bad if it obtained eleven Kingese,” Han Sen said casually. It sounded like he was trying to comfort the other prince.
“Ha! This guy is so arrogant. If he cannot get a word, what is he going to do?” Hearing Han Sen say that, Miss Mirror couldn’t help but laugh.
All the princes and princesses were shocked to hear this. Although they already knew that Bai Yi was the arrogant sort, they didn’t know his arrogance came along with a whole heap of ignorance, too.
“Does he not know what it means to get eleven Kingese symbols? Does he not know what Betrayal means?” Prince Nineteen held his face in his hands. He was speechless.
Bai Canglang laughed. “Old Sixteen is grumpy. He surely has a little bi-polar disorder. He never had a chance of being anyone important, so it’s not strange that he’s ignorant of what Betrayal means. But no matter how dumb he is, he should know what having eleven Kingese means. He is probably just being stubborn.”
“I really don’t know how this guy managed to claim the alpha statue.” That was still a sore spot for Prince Nineteen, it seemed.
Prince Nineteen had been to the Pavilion many times. He had wanted to keep coming until he claimed the alpha statue, but he had repeatedly failed. He couldn’t believe the alpha statue was actually claimed by that Bai Yi, who he had always looked down upon. He hated him. He hated Bai Yi, who was actually Han Sen in disguise.
“Let’s see how many Kingese he gets. It will be funny if he is unable to get any.”
“It is hard to say. After all, he did manage to claim the alpha statue. There is no way he’ll leave without a single one.”
“Who knows? Maybe getting the alpha statue was pure, dumb luck.”
“Then do you think he will receive the word Luck?”
“Perhaps.”
Many guards and royal children were watching intently. Han Sen’s eyes looked up at that tree that looked like a golden sky. He was looking at the Kingese symbols while he mumbled, “Give me a pretty man... Handsome man... Whatever it is... I do not want much... With my face... I should get a word like Fan, just as Bai Qing Xia did.”
While he was mumbling, Han Sen activated his Original Water King Body. His body became a blob of water, and even his armor became water. He was like a water man standing atop the dragon’s head. He was looking up at the gold sky.
Bai Yi’s personality was a grumpy one. He often started arguments. Everyone there had seen his Original Water King Body before, and so it was nothing surprising.
Compared to Bai Qing Xia’s Genzo King Body, the Original Water King Body wasn’t bad. But water was weak. It was better suited to healing abilities.
But Bai Yi was too ill-tempered. He didn’t want to learn a healing geno art. He had forced himself to learn a destructive water element skill instead, so he hadn’t achieved much. He wasn’t the number one compared to all those King class princes. He was in a medium-low bracket. Because of that, many of the royal children thought his Original Water King Body was rather weak.
In reality, the Original Water King Body wasn’t much worse than the Genzo King Body. Bai Yi had just never used it well.

Han Sen activated the Original Water King Body, and his body took on a water light. It connected with the king tree. The leaves rustled, and amidst their golden lights, a king leaf shone. The Kingese symbol was like a sun falling down. It was going to Han Sen.
That word was so watery, it looked like floating water. It looked like a scary wave. It was very pretty, and there was a heavy rain and a storm going with it. It possessed the word Shui.
Bai Yi received the word meaning water. Everyone expected this since he had the Original Water King Body. It would be weird if he didn’t receive water.
“It is better than nothing,” Han Sen thought. And so, he waited for the word to come down and touch his head.
As the word water was about to touch down on his head, Han Sen prepared to claim the Kingese power. But the word stopped one centimeter above his forehead.
Chapter 2340 First Person in a Thousand Year
Everyone was frozen. They didn’t know what was going on. Han Sen felt a sharp pain in his heart. He had no clue why the word water had just stopped above him.
The next second, the symbol on Han Sen’s forehead fired away from him like a cannonball. It whooshed back up into the sky, flying into the leaves at the top of the tree and vanishing.
“What is this?” Han Sen was frozen.
Every royal child and guard in King’s Garden stood as still as stone. They thought they must have been imagining things, and their eyes were opened wide in disbelief.
The king tree had stood in the center of the Extreme King territory for billions of years. There had never been a Kingese that saw its recipient, then high-tailed it back to where it came from.
“Haha! I cannot go on! I’m laughing too hard! Old Sixteen is way too funny. The Kingese that fell escaped his clutch.” Prince Nineteen held his belly while he laughed, tears of mirth welling in his eyes.
The water Kingese looked like a horny man, seeing a sexy woman with a great body. It quickly gave chase, but when it got close enough to see her face, it ran away faster than any rabbit.
“This... what’s going on?” Bai Ling Shuang was shocked. She hadn’t a clue what was happening.
Miss Mirror squinted her eyes. “It looks like he isn’t actually Bai Yi. The water Kingese was attracted by the Original Water King Body, but it noticed that there was a problem. And so, it decided to run back. I’m pretty sure he is actually Han Sen.”
“What is this? A fallen Kingese can go back?”
“I don’t know. I’ve never heard of something like this happen before.”
“Prince Sixteen looks a bit embarrassed. He is like a cooked duck that can still fly.”
“Haha! Not only that, but he must be the first of the Extreme King to have a Kingese run away from them.”
The princes and the princesses and the guards all exploded. This was the first time they had ever heard of such a thing. They were so hyped, it was as if they had been injected with chicken blood.








Han Sen thought this was bad. “Did the king tree notice that the Original Water King Body isn’t really mine? Is that why the Kingese ran back? If that is the case, many people might become suspicious of my identity. I have suffered some really bad luck here. If I knew this might happen, I would have just settled for collecting some king air and left.”
Han Sen was depressed. As everyone chattered and laughed about what had happened, the top of the king tree lit up.
The king leaves were suddenly all so bright, and a Kingese fell down like a sun. It came from the top of the tree, flying down to Han Sen’s forehead.
“Come! Come! Let us not have something bad this time. Come on!” Han Sen begged awkwardly. If this went wrong, everyone would know that there was something wrong with him.
The Kingese symbol fell down. Han Sen could see it, too. That word was so solid, unbreakable. It was like a stone that had been made a billion years ago. It said, “Ji.”
“That’s gay, why would I have a word like this? No, no, I’m not gay at all... It must mean gene or base... It must be... It must be...” Han Sen thought to himself.
Han Sen honestly didn’t care what the word was, as long as he had a word.
Everyone who watched this was now looking at Han Sen, trying to see what was happening. Some were actually hoping that the Kingese would escape again.
Quickly, the word landed on Han Sen’s head. Everyone held their breath. They stretched their necks to look at Han Sen’s head and the Ji word. They wanted to see if it would actually meld into him.
“Come on! Come down! Don’t make this any worse!” Han Sen was in a rush. He would have liked to just grab the word, cram it into his mouth, and swallow it.
It was a shame that grabbing Kingese symbols was impossible, though. If they could have, the royal children wouldn’t have had to wait. They would have just grabbed the Kingese by themselves.
Han Sen kept praying in his heart. The word Ji stopped one centimeter in front of Han Sen’s head. It didn’t actually touch down on his body.
“Sh*t! It is playing around with me again.” Han Sen wanted to cry.
“It stopped... It stopped...” Someone sounded so excited by the sight. They sounded like a kid that had never traveled abroad before and was finally going, with the way they screamed. It was like they were visiting a foreign place.
Prince Sixteen was getting really famous now. He was the first one to ever be abandoned by a Kingese.
“Hahaha! This is so funny.”
“But why do the Kingese refuse to touch down and meld into Brother Sixteen’s body?”
The whole of King’s Garden exploded. They had never thought something like this might happen, but now they were. Their nosy souls were burning.
Bai Qing Xia, who was closest to Han Sen, was also confused. He didn’t know what was going on with Han Sen.
“Huh? That is weird. The Ji word has stopped, but it hasn’t left.” Someone noticed this little issue, too.
The Ji word had stopped, but it didn’t escape like the water one did. It hung above Han Sen’s head as if it was in suspended animation.
“Brother, what the hell is this? If you are going to come down, then come down! Leave, if that is what you prefer. Why are you just hanging around here? There is no half-in, half-out. Are you just trying to scare me? Whatever it is you want to do, just get it over with.” Han Sen rolled his eyes and stared at the Ji Kingese. He was nervous.
Han Sen thought his luck had turned sour. He thought everything had gone awry. He had drawn too much attention in the Pavilion already. Now that this had happened, it was difficult for him not to appear suspicious.
“I need to be an honest person. I will never disguise myself as someone else again. I cannot deal with this kind of stress.” Han Sen’s eyes were burning. The Kingese wasn’t moving. It didn’t come down, and it didn’t go back. It just hung where it was.
Everyone was confused, but somehow, the top of the king tree became super bright again. Many king leaves lit up like a tapestry of suns.
Voila!

The suns began to fall like a meteor shower. Many Kingese fell down from the king tree. They were all coming for Han Sen like a galactic stream. It was like the stars were spilling forth in his direction.
“Sh*t! What is this?” Seeing all these flying Kingese symbols, Han Sen’s heart felt like it was going to jump out of his chest.
All of the royal children and guards looked on with wide eyes. Everyone was petrified.
Chapter 2341 The Secret of Kingese
“Brother, don’t do this! I only wanted to collect two Kingese. No, actually. Just one would have been fine. Can we stick to doing just that?” Han Sen felt his delicate nerves couldn’t endure this torture anymore.
This was testing the very functioning of his heart.
Fortunately, he didn’t have any sort of heart disease. If he had, he was certain that this would have given him a heart attack.
A huge swathe of Kingese symbols were falling from the tree. It was hard to describe. They were like a shower of gold stars falling down. It was like there was a bunch of gold tadpoles rushing towards Han Sen.
Han Sen’s right eye shone. The four pupils of the Purple-Eye Butterfly were spinning as they looked at the Kingese in the sky.
This wasn’t normal. Han Sen couldn’t imagine that the king tree did this regularly. There were so many Kingese symbols, and if they all went into his body, he thought he might explode.
It didn’t matter how good an abalone tasted, you would still die if you ate too much. With so many Kingese symbols falling from the tree, it wouldn’t be just his stomach rupturing. His whole body was sure to blow up.
Under the gaze of the Purple-Eye Butterfly, Han Sen could see that each Kingese symbol was comprised of a mysterious substance chain. It was a form of energy.
Each Kingese had one element of energy which made up their substance chain. There was nothing wrong with the Kingese symbols themselves.
Suddenly, Han Sen froze. He noticed something abnormal that made his heart almost stop.
Aside from the first word Ji, the other Kingese were falling down like bees. But even so, there were faster and slower ones.
Judging from the way they were coming down, it was going to start with Ji. Then, Han Sen saw something unbelievable occur.
“Stor... story... of... gene...” Han Sen read the Kingese that fell. The first four words, in their order, could be read as “the story of gene.”
“Is that just a coincidence?” Han Sen didn’t think a coincidence like this was possible.








There were many things in that world that looked like coincidences, but this coincidence was actually a connection. But most people didn’t have enough information to connect the seemingly random occurrences into a pattern.
Han Sen wanted to keep watching, but it was too late. The Ji word that landed on his forehead was blending into him.
A solid presence entered Han Sen’s body. It was like the anger inside of Han Sen was all removed. It was as if he had been condensing for one million years and now looked really solid.
Pat! Pat! Pat!
All those Kingese symbols went into Han Sen’s body. And because there were too many in the rush, some were unable to get into him via his forehead. They had to shoot straight into his body.
The Kingese symbols were like a meteor shower, and they shot straight into Han Sen. His presence kept changing because the Kingese kept entering.
As Han Sen was buried beneath the blazing symbols, the rest of the world was silent. Everyone stared stiffly at Han Sen, who was residing beneath the king tree. They could see all those Kingese lights rushing to enter his body.
Because it happened so fast, many people were caught mid-laugh. They couldn’t remove their smiles, and they just stood frozen. They looked very weird.
Miss Mirror was perfectly still. Her poise and elegance had been wholly extinguished. Her red lips were wide open. She looked so strange, and she could not speak.
She had managed Spring Rain for many years. She had done so many things for King Bai that had to be performed covertly. That meant Spring Rain might have been an assassination squad or a pirate organization, depending on how it was viewed.
Miss Mirror had seen many strange things over the years, but this gave her a big shock. It made her lose her composure.
No one had seen the Kingese fall like this in all the time since the Extreme King had first discovered the king tree.
In the time since their society began, the Extreme King had seventy kings and countless talented children. The prince that had received the most Kingese in the past managed to obtain one hundred. No one else had ever received more than that.
But comparing that prince to Bai Yi, that man meant nothing. There were so many Kingese falling from the tree. It was like a river bursting its banks. It was difficult to count. There were tens of thousands.
The King’s Garden looked dead. Everything was lit by the glow of the Kingese hitting Han Sen.
Han Sen was shocked. When all those Kingese symbols hit his body, The Story of Genes ran like mad.
Originally, The Story of Genes was like a sports car with an empty tank, but when the Kingese entered his body, The Story of Genes reacted like it had been injected with high-octane gas. The engine was firing on all cylinders, making some scary, mechanical noises. It surged forward at full speed.
Even the Ghost Bone Power inside Han Sen’s body had been crushed and refined. It kept pushing The Story of Genes forward.
The progress of The Story of Genes had previously been so slow, but now, it was welling up at mind-boggling speed. It kept breaking through, heading to the furthest point of a Duke.
“If this is related to The Story of Genes, what the f*ck is happening?” Han Sen was as shocked as he was happy.
He was pleased that The Story of Genes was reaching Duke class, even if he was uncertain how it was progressing so quickly. It was all happening inside his body, and ordinary folk wouldn’t be able to see that. But there were too many elites in the Extreme King. He couldn’t be certain that no one else would witness the changes occurring in his body.
Han Sen tried his best to stop The Story of Genes from being cast. He wanted to suppress The Story of Genes and keep it Marquise. Then, he could level up to Duke when there was no one else around.
But it was pointless to even try. As the Kingese kept running into him, The Story of Genes couldn’t be stopped. They kept diving into him like sports cars losing control on the highway.
“F*ck you! If you can’t stop, then push it!” Han Sen decided. He gritted his teeth and cast The Story of Genes. It was sending him to the far reaches of Duke class.
The Kingese were so strong. If Han Sen didn’t spend the power that the Kingese were giving him to level up The Story of Genes, the power would blow up his body.
There was no turning back now. The kingese had to push The Story of Genes as far as it could go. And it did indeed become Duke class.

Spell’s power suddenly had an element. Han Sen thought this would invoke changes in his body and draw attention.
But Han Sen realized that he need not have worried. Because the Kingese were still inside his body, continuing to change him like a mountain, a sea, a fire, a dragon, an overbearing thing, and like hell itself. Everything in that world appeared upon Han Sen at once.
When those changes became so complicated, the element that turned him into a Duke underwent a change, too. It wasn’t obvious, though. It was hard to see.
Chapter 2342 Kingese Blowing Up the Body
During the process of becoming a Duke, Han Sen’s Ghost Bone Power was wholly refined. Not a single drop of it remained. And that was just to bring him up to Duke level. The Story of Genes had to be fed a scary amount of power for ascension.
The Kingese symbols continued to fall, and it kept pushing The Story of Genes to run full throttle.
Quickly, The Story of Genes was opening its very first gene lock. But somehow, even though The Story of Genes was powerful, it was missing that last little push to open the gene lock. The Story of Genes continued to grow stronger and stronger.
Han Sen looked ill. His body was doing pretty poorly right now. The Kingese forced The Story of Genes to flood his interior with power, but all that surging strength had nowhere to go. The gene lock was still tightly shut, sealing in the power. It was like a river was dammed, and the water couldn’t go anywhere. Sooner or later, the dam was bound to buckle and collapse, resulting in the water bursting everywhere.
Han Sen’s body was this dam. If the water broke through, then Han Sen’s body would be destroyed. How could he be happy about that?
“Oh no! The gene lock. Surely the gene lock doesn’t have to be opened by Duke genes, right?” Under the force of The Story of Genes, Han Sen was unable to break the gene lock. And he had also just realized why. His body was different from the average person or creature of the geno universe. One hundred Duke genes could open one geno lock, but now, with so much power going into him, he didn’t have what it took to break the same lock. That had to be why.
Although he couldn’t confirm his guess, the power of the Kingese was becoming stronger. Even his Original Water King Body couldn’t hold it.
The body was like water, thrashing around like mad. It was like there was some power disturbing it, with no rhyme or reason. It created a small swirl.
Luckily, this was the Original Water King Body’s body he had. His body could heal quickly. If he was a normal king, the power being sent his way would have already ripped him apart at the seams.
Even though the Original Water King Body had great regenerative properties, it had absorbed too much Kingese. He himself was now shining gold. The water appeared bloated, and the water body was a few times bigger than it had been before. It became a giant, gold orb of water.
The more Kingese that fell, the bigger the orb of water became. It was going to pop any second.
There weren’t many Kingese left to fall, and Han Sen gritted his teeth, trying to withstand it. His body felt absolutely terrible. He was going to blow up. A countless number of Kingese symbols were inside his body.
Fortunately, he hadn’t blown up yet.
When the last Kingese landed on Han Sen, he sighed.








But the next second, Han Sen’s face looked utterly terrible. All the Kingese symbols inside him were rioting through his body. The scary power broke Han Sen’s body, and he didn’t even have a chance to fight back.
Bai Ling Shuang looked at Han Sen with a complicated stare. And suddenly, the orb of water Han Sen had become, exploded. He burst into a hanging mist. He was shining like a gold diamond.
Each drop had gold Kingese spinning inside it. It was a stange sight.
After a while, the light of the Kingese dimmed. The mist flowed back together to reform the shape of that water man. Then Han Sen’s face became visible.
Han Sen was so happy. Luckily, the Original Water King Body had allowed him to gather himself up again. No matter how strong another king body was, being blown up like that would have rendered them very dead.
The water body became flesh, revealing Han Sen with a pale face. The Original Water King Body could recompose the general structure of a body, but he was still damaged and in quite a bit of pain.
“Brother Seventeen, it looks like I win,” Han Sen said, turning to Bai Qing Xia.
Bai Qing Xia looked back and coldly said, “I understand now how a genius like you could claim the alpha statue. You really are quite special. I have indeed lost.”
Han Sen took two steps away, with the intent of getting out of that place. But even in those short steps, he almost fell over. He felt so weak that he could barely stand.
Han Sen waved to his blood kirin, and the blood kirin moved quickly over to his side. Han Sen pulled himself onto the creature’s back so it could take him out of King’s Garden.
Prince Sixteen Bai Yi had triggered the Kingese to fall like stars. The news of this event was sent to every far corner of King’s Kingdom in a short amount of time.
Bai Yi once had a really bad reputation, but now he was sounding much better.
Han Sen made an excuse to go back and hide on Planet Water Zone, claiming he had been terribly injured by the Kingese. He wanted to be left alone, but even so, many people came to visit him.
One of his visitors was a deified water elite sent by King Bai himself. She claimed she had come there to heal Han Sen, but it was actually because King Bai was suspicious of Han Sen. He wanted the elite to examine Han Sen’s body, top to bottom.
After all, Bai Yi wasn’t very talented. And he had suddenly claimed the alpha statue and triggered the unbelievable events beneath the king tree. King Bai had grown very suspicious of him, and that was why he asked the water deified to go and heal Han Sen. He wanted Han Sen’s body to be examined to confirm that it was really Prince Sixteen Bai Yi.
“Captain Water Moon, how is Yi’er doing?” King Bai asked tonelessly.
Captain Water Moon answered, “Prince Sixteen isn’t doing well. His body is full of that Kingese power. It is everywhere. He cannot use his Original Water King Body or any of his other powers like usual. I couldn’t find a way to fix it, either.”
“Can’t his Original Water King Body separate and process the Kingese power?” King Bai frowned.
Captain Water Moon explained gravely, “If this was a normal body, Prince Sixteen would have died when his body first exploded. His Original Water King Body is the only reason he survived. But that is also the reason the Kingese power has invaded his original water substance. It will be impossible to separate the two. It cannot be done by an external force. To clear the Kingese inside the water, you would have to break the water. That would also mean killing Prince Sixteen.”
“Is there no other way?” King Bai asked, while looking at Captain Water Moon.
“I am useless in this matter.” Captain Water Moon shook her head.
Not long after Captain Water Moon left, Miss Mirror came into King Bai’s study.
“Little Sister, check out Sixteen and give me an answer quickly,” King Bai said to Miss Mirror as soon as she entered.
Miss Mirror looked at King Bai and asked, “You think there is a problem with Bai Yi?”
“As a father, I hope he really is this good, but...” before King Bai finished, he waved his hand. “Go. Get me an answer quickly, and forbid Bai Yi from leaving King’s Kingdom in the meantime.”
“Yes.” Miss Mirror bowed and departed the study.

“Han Sen,” Miss Mirror murmured after she left the study. A very creepy smile crossed her face.
Chapter 2343 Identity Crisis
Han Sen’s balls ached. People kept talking about him and the Kingese he had absorbed as if he was some godly being that had paid them a visit. It was as if he was the crown prince or something. Even people with little interest in politics were caught up in the popular topic of conversation, fascinated by the idea that the previously-unknown prince had suddenly become so famous. Even King Bai was suddenly paying him a lot of attention. There was every chance he’d become a higher figure in the hierarchy, or even the new crown prince.
But Han Sen knew that many people were still suspicious regarding his identity. Many royals came to visit him. They were all trying to test Han Sen, especially the horrible friends that Bai Yi used to have. They wanted to skin him and get a look at Bai Yi’s bones.
Han Sen used the excuse of needing to heal to block the intrusions of such people.
Of course, Han Sen’s body was in some trouble, too. Those Kingese symbols had blended into his cells, and it made his body far stronger than his actual presence. He was like a steel board, and it was a struggle for him to circulate his energy.
But that wasn’t too big of a problem for Han Sen. The Story of Genes could be cast normally. As long as The Story of Genes could level up, he could absorb the Kingese power so it wouldn’t interfere with any of his other powers that were running.
Now, Han Sen was only missing Duke genes. One hundred Duke genes were necessary for the opening of a gene lock. Opening two or three gene locks should allow him to absorb all the Kingese.
When Captain Water Moon came, she healed his injuries from the explosion. Aside from being unable to use powers, Han Sen was back to normal.
His body was stuffed to the brim with Kingese. If someone wanted to hurt him, they would have to earn the approval of the Kingese. At this point, Han Sen felt as if he wouldn’t even have to use his energy to fight. He could use the Kingese in his body to fight against foes that were currently stronger than he was.
The bad thing was that the Kingese couldn’t be activated on their own. Han Sen needed to touch someone to activate the Kingese inside his body.
“It looks like I need to hunt down some xenogeneics,” Han Sen thought to himself. He took the blood kirin with him and dove into the deep sea. There was nothing special about the xenogeneics inhabiting Planet Water Zone, but there were some Duke xenogeneics lurking about. They were the ones that Bai Yi had looked over most frequently. And in regards to the King class creatures that lived on the planet, they had mostly been killed by Bai Yi already.
“Very good. You have the protection of Kingese. Was this a calculated move on your part, to push you into becoming a King? Should big sister start calling you a King already?” Han Sen had just ventured into the deep sea when a woman appeared beside him. Before he had found any xenogeneics, Fox Queen had come to see him.
“Why are you here? Aren’t you afraid of being found out?” Han Sen looked around. Luckily, there weren’t many people occupying Planet Water Zone. Bai Yi hadn’t bothered to hire guards for patrols, and Lan Haixin’s people weren’t going to be around.
“What are you afraid of? My good little brother is going to become a King. You understand that your big sister would want to come and share in your victory, of course,” Fox Queen said quietly. She came close to Han Sen and leaned on his chest. Her fingers twirled and played with Han Sen’s hair.
“Stop teasing me, big sister. I will be doomed very soon.” Han Sen bore a wry smile.








Fox Queen reached out her hand to touch Han Sen on the forehead. She gently said to him, “You know you are in trouble, huh? So, why are you trying to keep such a high profile? You keep on causing such big incidents and causing so much trouble for yourself. Not even the Fox, when undercover, would dare be as loud as you. It is like you are afraid people do not recognize you.”
“I didn’t know things would come to this,” Han Sen said with a shrug of his shoulders.
Fox Queen rolled her eyes and said, “I cannot help you with this. The others might accept what you’ve done, but King Bai must surely be suspicious about your identity. If I have guessed it correctly, he will likely be asking Miss Mirror to investigate you. This woman is very cruel, and she has destroyed many races. I don’t know how many deified elites she has brought down. If she notices anything wrong about you, you can consider yourself a very dead boy.”
“Please tell me what to do, sister,” Han Sen said quickly. If Fox Queen had come all the way here, it wouldn’t have been for the sole purpose of teasing him.
Fox Queen squeezed Han Sen’s cheek and smiled. “Due to the fact you are my good little brother, I have an idea. It entirely depends on whether or not you are brave enough to go through with it.”
“What is it?” Han Sen didn’t move.
Fox Queen sighed and said, “Since you know about Cher, I’m not going to hide anything. I want to reclaim a treasure from the Extreme King. But now, we have run into some turbulent trouble. It is because of this that we require your help. If you help me get the item, we will escape the Extreme King together. And then, you and I can be together and disappear from this world. Doesn’t that sound very romantic?”
“What is the item that you want to get, and where can I get it from?” Han Sen didn’t dare make a promise, and he pretended not to hear her last remark.
If even a woman as powerful as Fox Queen had failed to retrieve what she wanted, that wasn’t a good sign. Whatever the item was, it had to be difficult to retrieve.
Fox Queen didn’t hesitate to say, “It is inside Destiny’s Tower. Even a royal of the Extreme King cannot enter. A royal child has to do something incredible to gain permission to access that place. I talked to Bai Canglang, but I was unable to enter Destiny’s Tower with him.”
“If Bai Canglang cannot get in, it is useless for you to come to me about it.” Upon hearing that her target was Destiny’s Tower, Han Sen knew he wouldn’t be working with her. Stealing an item from that place was suicide.
Ever since Han Sen had seen the Destiny’s Tower of the Extreme King, he had been very interested in it. He researched the structure quite thoroughly, and before he had even assumed the identity of Bai Yi, he learned something interesting about the place. Han Sen soon came to learn how scary and mysterious Destiny’s Tower really was.
Han Sen was very curious about the tower, but he hadn’t done anything about it yet. He wasn’t going to let Fox Queen get him killed.
Plus, he didn’t trust Fox Queen. She said they would escape together, but Han Sen didn’t believe her.
Fox Queen lifted a finger and set it down on Han Sen’s lips. Her eyes looked very seductive, and she said, “Bai Yi might not have been able to gain access, but you are different. You claimed the Extreme King alpha’s statue. And you are the Bai Yi that earned so many Kingese symbols. It shouldn’t be hard for you to gain access to Destiny’s Tower.”
“How do I get in?” Han Sen’s heart jumped. He wasn’t going to help her, but he wanted to get inside, anyway. Hearing Fox Queen’s idea about how to get in would be nice, so perhaps she would prove a little useful.
“Promise to work with me, and then you will know.” Fox Queen’s slender finger touched Han Sen’s cheek. She smiled. “You can think about it, but you don’t have much time. I hope that the next time you visit me, you will give me a pleasing answer.”
After that, Fox Queen fell back and disappeared into the water.
Chapter 2344 The Crime of Killing
“Sure, I’d go with you to steal things from Destiny’s Tower. If I was insane,” Han Sen mumbled to himself. He had no intention of cooperating with Fox Queen.
For now, his identity hadn’t yet been exposed. He could still deny any allegations that came up, but stealing something from Destiny’s Tower was akin to asking for death.
“My Prince! My Prince!” Han Sen was planning on hunting down some Duke xenogeneics when he heard Lilly’s voice.
“I just wanted to kill some monsters to collect xenogeneics genes. Can’t you just leave me alone for a bit?” Han Sen felt depressed. That Siren servant Lilly was coming after him, repeatedly calling out for her prince.
Lilly was a Siren, too, but she had been raised by Bai Yi’s mother. She wasn’t with Lan Haixin. As a result, she was the only servant that Bai Yi had.
Perhaps Lilly still remembered that Bai Yi’s mother had been good to her, and that was why she decided to stick with Bai Yi. She was really loyal to him, and her only goal was to serve him well. It was rare to witness such loyalty.
“My Prince, it is good that you are here... the Sentence Court... the Sentence Court’s people are here... They... They said the blood kirin went against the rules of King’s Garden...” Lilly swam to him, gasping as she spoke.
Han Sen frowned and said, “Where are they?”
The blood kirin had killed Prince Swordstar’s guard in King’s Garden. Han Sen knew that incident would come back to bite him. He just didn’t expect the turnaround to have happened so quickly.
“They are in Ocean Hall. The princess is greeting them right now. She wants you to return so that you can provide them with an explanation,” Lilly said.
“Okay. I will go and talk to them, then.” Han Sen had to give up on his plans for hunting right now. He followed Lilly back to Underwater Town.
Lan Haixin was sitting in the palace, her face expressionless. She didn’t look good.
Han Sen had been hiding in the garden, and she had dealt with all the nobles that came visiting. If she didn’t need Han Sen to open the Siren relic, she wouldn’t have cared about him at all.
Now, though, the people from the Sentence Court were visiting. This wasn’t something she could handle alone, and so she had to let Han Sen deal with these matters by himself.








Lan Haixin didn’t know how Bai Yi had earned the Kingese protection, but she knew how easily he could cause trouble.
“It was so hard for me to get a half-deified guard, and it has caused so much trouble. The killing in King’s Garden has brought the Sentence Court knocking on our door. There is no way he will be allowed to keep the blood kirin,” Haixin thought to herself.
“Who is looking for me?” Han Sen brought the blood kirin in with him from the outside.
“I am Chu Nan from the Sentence Court, My Prince.” The half-deified elite in the lobby slowly bowed to Han Sen.
“Ah, it is Courtman Chu. Why have you come looking for me?” Han Sen knew, but he asked anyway.
Chu Nan signaled to a man next to him. The servant presented Han Sen with a document. Chu Nan himself said, “I am so sorry, My Prince. Your blood kirin murdered Prince Swordstar’s guard in King’s Garden. Prince Swordstar told us in the Sentence Court. We are here to arrest him, so please forgive us.”
After that, the two servants came forward to arrest the blood kirin. But Han Sen stopped them.
Chu Nan quietly said, “My Prince, this is an order that comes directly from the Sentence Court. Please do not make this any more complicated than it needs to be. If we cannot bring him back today, then it will force the captain to visit. Then, things will be far worse.”
Han Sen laughed and said, “I’m not making anything complicated. The blood kirin is my guard, and I’m the one that commanded it to kill in King’s Garden. So, I am the leader that caused this. The crime is mine. I will go with you. There are rules, and I need to be judged. I am a prince, so I should follow the law.”
After that, Han Sen reached out his hands. He told Chu Nan he could lock him up so they could leave.
Chu Nan and the others were shocked. People had been killed in King’s Garden before, and the princes were usually responsible, but they always pinned the murders on their guards. But now, this was in reverse. The prince was taking the crime for the guard. They looked flabbergasted.
“In that case, My Prince, we are so sorry. We do not need to cuff you. Please, just come with us.” Chu Nan didn’t formally arrest Han Sen, but he didn’t plan to let him go, either.
The Sentence Court was allowed to lock up figures of royalty. If Han Sen wanted to take responsibility for the crime, then Chu Nan wouldn’t stop him.
There were connections between Prince Swordstar and the Sentence Court. What happened with the blood kirin required an explanation. It would have been great if Bai Yi really had committed the crime, as he would have felt much better.
Lan Haixin watched Han Sen and the blood kirin get taken away. She looked sick, and she said, “Is that guy crazy? He is going to jail on behalf of some silly mount. He has lost all his pride as a prince.”
Han Sen followed Chu Nan to the Sentence Court. He was locked in the prison there, and he had to wait for the trial before being sent to the proper penitentiary.
“Bai Yi is going to take the crime that he murdered in King’s Garden. Is he crazy?” Prince Swordstar, when he heard this news, was shocked.
But then, a wide smile crossed his face. He said, “That is good. If he wants to die, then we just let him. Murdering in the King’s Garden will have him stuck in prison for a hundred years, even if he is a prince.”
The Sentence Court captain, who was trimming a fern, heard what the prince said and laughed. “If it was an ordinary noble, they would be served a death sentence. But he is a Prince, and it was a guard that was killed. He will probably be in jail for a dozen years. It is hard to tell exactly how long, though.”
“Ten years is still good.” Prince Swordstar rolled his eyes and went on to say, “Right, just don’t let that blood kirin go, either. Does he think he can save everyone? Who does he think he is?”
“Of course. The laws of the Extreme King are fair. We will not wrong a good man. We will not let go of a bad man,” the Sentence Court captain said coldly.
Chu Nan brought Han Sen and the blood kirin to jail. He opened the door and said, “My Prince, I am sorry that you have to live here.”
Han Sen didn’t walk inside. He looked at Chu Nan and said, “Mister Chu, can I ask a favor of you?”
“I...” Chu Nan looked conflicted.
“It is nothing big. Can I have him in the same prison cell as me?” Han Sen stroked the blood kirin’s head as he spoke.
“That is okay...” Chu Nan looked at Han Sen strangely. Hesitantly, he said, “My Prince... are you really planning on accepting responsibility for this crime?”

“I would like to, but I’m afraid others will not allow me to,” Han Sen said simply.
Chu Nan was confused. He understood Bai Yi’s situation. Although he had done two things that shocked the entirety of the Extreme King, that couldn’t pardon him from the crime. Since the guard had been killed, Han Sen would end up going to prison if Prince Swordstar did not relent.
Even if it was the crown prince that stood accused, he would get a guard to admit the crime. If he confessed to the crime like Han Sen, he would end up going to jail, as well.
Chapter 2345 Mirror Spirit Eye
Chu Nan locked the door to Han Sen and the blood kirin’s jail cell, and he was just about to leave when someone else walked up. It was Prince Swordstar.
“My Prince.” Chu Nan and his servant bowed courteously.
“Good work, Mister Chu,” Prince Swordstar said. He walked in front of the prison’s erected Bai Sema. He looked at Han Sen through the Bai Sema and grinned. “Brother Sixteen, how are you feeling?”
“This place is quite comfy. I get free food, free rent, and I like the mellow vibes. I’m not sure I ever want to leave,” Han Sen replied, while lying on the bed.
Prince Swordstar laughed menacingly. “Bai Yi, you really think that no one will touch you because you’re a prince? Do you really think you can wash away the crime upon the blood kirin?”
“What if I do?” Han Sen continued to lie casually on his back. The bed was a little hard, but for someone who was used to roughing it, it wasn’t a big deal.
Prince Swordstar wasn’t a fan of Han Sen’s attitude. He mocked him by saying, “Brother Sixteen, you are so naive and cute. The Sentence Court is not someplace where you can do whatever you want. You are just a prince. During our long history, even a few crown princes have been locked up in prison.”
“I know. There are laws, and this is how things should be.” Han Sen maintained his position on the bed, acting as if he didn’t care.
Prince Swordstar was there to rile Han Sen up with a display of his victory, but seeing Han Sen behave like this, he no longer felt like a winner. He actually felt annoyed.
Han Sen didn’t want to stay in prison. Luckily, he had discovered through Fox Queen that Miss Mirror was in the middle of investigating him. He knew he wouldn’t be in jail for long, because Miss Mirror would be unable to investigate him if he was actually given a ten-year sentence.
Prince Swordstar didn’t know that Miss Mirror was investigating Han Sen. As he looked at Han Sen, he noticed the blood kirin. He frowned and asked Chu Nan, “Mister Chu, my Brother Sixteen is a noble. Can’t he have a cell all to himself?”
“It’s fine. I am happy like this,” Han Sen said carefully before Chu Nan returned.
After all, he had personally asked Chu Nan to let the blood kirin stay with him. He had to say something.
Chu Nan said, “He is only in lock-up for now. Keeping them both here will make things easier until the trial.”










Prince Swordstar lifted his lips in a snarl and quietly told Han Sen, “Bai Yi, are you naive enough to think that nothing will happen if you take the fall? I am telling you right now, you will really go to jail. And the blood kirin will die. You cannot do anything about it. This is the consequence of challenging me.”
“Wow, you are so powerful. I admire you.” Han Sen was still lying on the bed, and he clapped his hands in the most uncaring way possible.
“You...” Prince Swordstar was so angry. He shouted at the worker and said, “Get the blood kirin out! Separate the two and treat them well.”
Chu Nan looked hesitant, but he still allowed the servant to proceed and open the gate.
He hesitated because Prince Swordstar didn’t have any authority in the Sentence Court, but the captain was Prince Swordstar’s uncle. Things could go badly for him if he didn’t listen to the prince.
“Since when did the Sentence Court become a prince’s manor?” The voice of a powerful woman bellowed from the outside.
When Prince Swordstar and Chu Nan heard it, their faces paled. They turned around and saw Miss Mirror approaching them, clad in royal garb.
Chu Nan was incredibly frustrated. The Sentence Court for the Extreme King was supposed to be a hellhole. When ordinary nobles heard about it, they would do their best to avoid it. Today, it was more like a bar where anyone could come and go as they pleased.
But Chu Nan wouldn’t dare to provoke the woman before him. He bowed and said, “Greetings, Miss Mirror.”
Prince Swordstar quickly bowed as well. There were many people in the Extreme King that they couldn’t provoke, and Miss Mirror was in the top three. Prince Swordstar would rather upset King Bai than this one.
Prince Swordstar was King Bai’s son. Even if King Bai was angry, he wouldn’t do anything to him. It was difficult to tell how things would turn out with Miss Mirror, though. She was famous for having grand mood swings and being very cruel. Many powerful people with great ambitions in the Extreme King had been destroyed under the thumb of Miss Mirror.
“Mister Chu, why is Prince Sixteen here?” Miss Mirror looked at the jail cell that held Han Sen.
“Auntie Princess, in the King’s Garden, Brother Sixteen allowed his guard...” Prince Swordstar came up to her to explain.
“Swordstar, what is your position in the Sentence Court?” Miss Mirror turned hard eyes on Prince Swordstar.
Prince Swordstar was struck with a chill, and he suddenly found himself unable to speak.
“Miss Mirror, there is an investigation that requires Prince Sixteen’s cooperation.” Chu Nan had heard Miss Mirror’s tone, and he knew right away that this was bad. He refrained from telling her the truth.
“There is something I need from Bai Yi, too. I will be taking him back with me for now,” Miss Mirror said. Someone had already walked in and brought Han Sen and the blood kirin out of their cell.
“Miss Mirror, this...” Chu Nan felt as if he had two paths to choose from. He could either let it go or not let it go.
“Auntie Princess, killing in the King’s Garden is an important crime,” Prince Swordstar said in a rush. He ran in front of Miss Mirror in his plight.
As this occurred, Chu Nan’s phone rang. He looked at the number and accepted the call. He turned off his phone and spoke to Miss Mirror, “Miss Mirror has already discussed this with the captain. Why did you not tell me this? What are you guys doing here? Move! Do not stop Miss Mirror from attending to her business.”
Miss Mirror didn’t even look at Prince Swordstar. She walked right past him.
“Little Brother, I don’t have time to watch you play. If you want to put on a show in the future, please call me first. I will make sure I allocate the time.” Han Sen walked in front of Prince Swordstar, speaking to him while he fixed his sleeves. Then, he brought the blood kirin with him as he walked away.
“That a**hole!” Prince Swordstar was so mad, it looked like he was going to breathe fire. His face was in a wretched contortion.
“What? You aren’t going to thank me for saving you?” Miss Mirror said to Han Sen as they entered the car she had brought.
“Auntie Princess, I think you have work reasons for freeing me. I will still have to go back later. I don’t know if I should be thanking you yet,” Han Sen answered, looking directly at Miss Mirror as he spoke.
Miss Mirror’s face was impassive, and her gaze was frosty as she looked at Han Sen. “Han Sen, how dare you? You killed a prince, and you dare to disguise yourself as him! You really don’t understand the danger you are in.”

When Han Sen heard what she said, his heart jumped. He acted cool and said, “Auntie Princess, what do you mean? I do not understand.”
Miss Mirror didn’t move. She pointed at the ring on Han Sen’s finger. “Han Sen, where did you get this ring from?”
“This is Han Sen’s item. I got it when I took his body,” Han Sen said.
Miss Mirror laughed darkly. “Are you aware that this ring is called Mirror Spirit Eye? It can reflect a person’s soul. If you are Bai Yi, take a look at yourself in the Mirror Spirit Eye. It will see whether your soul is Han Sen’s or Bai Yi’s.”
Chapter 2346 Identity Exposed
Han Sen didn’t believe what Miss Mirror told him. He had inspected that ring many times, and he had never seen any semblance of a soul inside it.
When Han Sen heard what she said, he raised his hand. He tilted the ring’s green, eye-shaped gem toward his own face. He examined the gem’s reflective surface carefully, and said, “I do see my own reflection, but any gem would show me that.”
Miss Mirror laughed. She lifted her left hand.
Miss Mirror’s hand was white, and her fingers were long and thin. There was a ring on her ring finger.
Seeing that ring, Han Sen’s heart leaped. That ring looked exactly the same as his, aside from the fact that it was a little bit smaller.
Miss Mirror lightly touched the green gem with her finger, and the eye-like stone started to glow.
The ring on Han Sen’s finger trembled slightly. They both lit up in the same way.
At that moment, Han Sen felt the gem on the ring come alive. It was like a real eye looking at him.
In that eye, he could see his own reflection. But the gem wasn’t reflecting Han Sen as he was now; instead, it showed Han Sen as a naked baby.
Han Sen felt a pang of panic roll through him. He hadn’t expected the ring to reveal anything incriminating, and it was too late for him to take it off.
“Auntie Princess, what is that geno art you used? It is quite interesting. But stop joking around with me,” Han Sen said. He kept his composure strong and unwavering.
Miss Mirror lowered her left hand, and the light of the rings went dim. She looked like she was smiling, but she wasn’t. “You have a silver tongue, but it won’t do you any good. If I hand you over to the king, how long do you think it will take for you to die? It might take tens of thousands of years. I’m afraid death wouldn’t be granted to you for a long, long time.”
Han Sen had a wry smile on his face. He had planned to talk Miss Mirror into believing that he was truly Bai Yi, so he could buy himself some time to formulate a plan for escaping the Extreme King.
But this was the first time they had met, and already, his identity had been exposed. All his plans of escape had now been reduced to nothing more than a ridiculous joke.








“If you have something you want to say, then get on with it and spit it out.” Han Sen sighed.
“There is nothing to tell you. You will be sentenced to death. I will take you to the palace and let the king decide,” Miss Mirror said flatly.
“If that was what you really intended, then there was no point in confronting me here,” Han Sen said, as he looked at Miss Mirror.
Miss Mirror didn’t respond. She just looked at Han Sen with interest as the car traveled onward.
Han Sen quickly realized that the car wasn’t headed for the palace. They went to the biggest starport that could be found in King’s Kingdom.
“Where are we going?” Han Sen asked, following Miss Mirror out of the car and onto a battleship. The battleship soon took off, heading out of King’s Kingdom. He was shocked.
Instead of answering his question, Miss Mirror sent for someone to take him to another room.
Han Sen didn’t know what Miss Mirror intended to do. She was Bai Wei’s aunt and a trusted adviser of King Bai. If she noticed Han Sen was a fake, she should have grabbed him by the collar and marched him before King Bai.
Instead, they were leaving King’s Kingdom. She hadn’t decided to incarcerate him, either. She just had him and the blood kirin taken to an ordinary room. The blood kirin wasn’t locked up, either.
“What does this Miss Mirror want?” Han Sen wondered, but try as he might, he couldn’t guess what the woman was planning.
Han Sen touched the Mirror Spirit Eye. He wanted to take it off, but ever since the ring had been activated by Miss Mirror, it was as if the piece of jewelry had melded into his hand. He was now unable to remove it.
“What the hell is this ring?” Han Sen wondered, frustrated by the fact that he couldn’t activate the Mirror Spirit Eye ring.
“I’ll have to take whatever opportunities come my way. It looks as if I’m not talented enough to be a spy. I was exposed very easily,” Han Sen thought to himself. “But if Miss Mirror hasn’t brought me to King Bai, and I’m no longer in the confines of King’s Kingdom, there is a chance that I can escape. The only bad thing is that Bao’er is still in Lan Haixin’s place. How am I supposed to get her out of there?”
The ship made a series of hyperspeed jumps that took them through multiple systems after they left King’s Kingdom. Han Sen had no idea where Miss Mirror was taking him.
When the battleship finally came to a stop, Han Sen realized he was now in a system he had never seen before. The planet was very cold, and it was still in a very primitive stage of development. There were no creatures of high intelligence about, and there were no xenogeneics. There were only low level creatures around.
But for such a primitive planet, it was surrounded by a surprising number of battleships and airships from a variety of different races. Han Sen followed Miss Mirror down onto the surface of the planet, and he saw many races that were familiar to him. There was the Dragon, Demon, Buddha, Destroyed, and all sorts of others were represented.
Han Sen noticed something rather odd, though. Everyone who had been sent to the planet’s surface, no matter which race they were from, possessed water powers.
Even if they didn’t come from a water-aligned species, they were at least proficient in water-based techniques. They were all King class, too. It was rare to find a Duke in their ranks.
“What is this place?” Han Sen couldn’t help but ask Miss Mirror.
“This is a nameless system of no notability,” she replied.
“What are we doing here?” Han Sen asked with a frown.
“We are attending a funeral,” Miss Mirror answered simply.
“A funeral? Whose funeral?” Han Sen was confused. Instead of handing Han Sen over to King Bai, Miss Mirror had dragged him all this way to attend a funeral. This was weird.
“Time is almost up. Let’s find a seat.” Miss Mirror looked around and walked to a peak.
If Miss Mirror didn’t want to answer Han Sen, then he had no choice but to follow along behind her.
Han Sen didn’t plan on running. First, he might not have to flee, and even if he could, this was not the time. Bao’er was still in the Extreme King, so there was no use in him running off all alone.

Plus, a woman like Miss Mirror would probably have contingencies in place for any escapes Han Sen might attempt.
Han Sen and Miss Mirror reached the top of the peak, and a guard brought her a chair and an umbrella. It was as if she was on vacation.
Han Sen didn’t receive the same lovely treatment. He just stood next to the blood kirin, trying to see what Miss Mirror was inspecting. The only thing in front of them was a large sea. It was very quiet, and no creatures were visible within its depths. There was nothing special to see.
Chapter 2347 Getting News
“I can’t even see a graveyard nearby. What important person died and is going to be buried here? Are they going to scatter the ashes into the ocean, maybe? Like a burial at sea?” Han Sen wondered.
To be entirely honest, Han Sen didn’t actually believe Miss Mirror’s claim. But with so many elites having shown up, something big had to have been going down.
The elites of the other races were all terrified of Miss Mirror. None dared to get close to her.
Most of them milling around near the sea, though. They were all waiting for something to occur, just as Miss Mirror was.
But after a few days went by, nothing actually happened. Han Sen saw no evidence of the funeral that Miss Mirror had claimed would take place.
It had been six days by this point, and now, after all this time, Han Sen couldn’t but ask a question. “Miss Mirror, has the funeral not begun?”
Miss Mirror was being taken care of by her servants in the meantime, as if she was on vacation. She had nice food to enjoy, and people served her everything. They almost moved a bathtub there for her. She was living in what was practically splendor. Han Sen and the blood kirin, on the other hand, hadn’t had a bite to eat over that entire length of time. Han Sen had reached the point where he could survive on the sustenance provided by absorbing universal energies, so while he would be fine, it was still pretty uncomfortable.
“Why are you in such a rush? He isn’t dead yet,” Miss Mirror responded carelessly.
Han Sen’s eyes widened, and he thought to himself, “They’re planning a funeral for someone who hasn’t yet died? And so many people are already here. Aren’t they the ones in a rush? If the dying guy knew about this, he’d probably be so angry that he’d have a heart attack and die immediately.”
Han Sen thought this was a very strange scenario, but Miss Mirror seemed unwilling to answer any other questions. So, there was nothing he could do about it.
“Miss Mirror, can I walk around? I am hungry, and I want some food to eat. Do not worry, I will not go far.” Han Sen looked at Miss Mirror.
“You can go anywhere you wish. Just make sure you return before the funeral.” Han Sen hadn’t expected Miss Mirror to agree so simply. It was a quick response, as if she really had no desire to keep him imprisoned.
“Thank you, madam.” Han Sen turned around and abandoned the peak. After a while, he turned back to take a look. Miss Mirror wasn’t watching him, and she hadn’t sent anyone to keep tabs on him. It seemed as if she really did not care.
“Does she know that I won’t run off?” Han Sen thought that Miss Mirror was a very strange woman. He wasn’t going to dare trying to escape. He couldn’t allow himself to run until he had retrieved Bao’er, at the very least.








After leaving the peak, Han Sen soon found that many elites from all sorts of races were present. Many of the races he saw were ones he had never seen before. After looking a little further, he found that a temporary market had been established.
Han Sen felt relief well up in his heart, and he took off flying to the market immediately. There were many races occupying the various stalls. Lots of vendors had positioned themselves near the sea, many of them selling all sorts of xenogeneic items.
There were all kinds of levels, too. Some of the people around him looked like Viscounts or Barons, some looked like Kings, and some were of a capacity Han Sen couldn’t even identify. Those were very scary.
Again, he noticed that all the creatures there had water element powers.
“This surely cannot be a coincidence. Is something going to happen here that is associated with water powers? I already have that Original Water King Body. Is that why Miss Mirror has brought me here?” That didn’t seem right, though. Captain Water Moon was a deified water elite. If this was an important opportunity for water-users, Miss Mirror wouldn’t have needed to bring a fraudulent prince there.
Han Sen walked into the market. There were so many people and creatures there, so he figured it would be easy to collect some info. Everyone was talking to the vendors, after all.
Han Sen walked around and watched the crowds before squatting down in front of a stall. He didn’t choose the stall because of its wares, but because the stall’s owner was low level. He could be bullied. Plus, it was one of the Kate. Therefore, in the consideration of other races, he was practically a nobody. His stall was in a corner and barely even noticeable.
Of course, Han Sen wanted to bully him. It would be faster to get info out of him through doing that than by being pleasant.
“Big Brother, what I sell are true water xenogeneic treasures. What would you like?” The Kate Baron smiled, introducing his unremarkable wares with genuine enthusiasm.
“Who is your big brother?” Han Sen put on a dour expression.
“Oh... I am sorry, Hot Man,” the Kate Baron said quickly.
“That’s more like it.” Han Sen nodded, but inside, he thought, “No, I am here to play the bad guy. I should be called a boss.”
Pretending to be evil didn’t suit Han Sen very well, so he gave up the act. He pulled out a Viscount dagger and held it before the Baron. He said, “Do you know what this is?”
“Handsome, I’m sorry! We do small business here. We only sell, and we do not buy. What about over there? That guy is so rich, he is sure to give you a high price.” The owner looked fairly glum.
“Who said I am trying to sell you something? Look at me. Do I look broke enough to sell my goods to someone like you?” Han Sen tossed the dagger down in front of the owner and spoke with a rich tone of voice. “Answer my questions and this can be yours.”
“You are here for information? You could have just told me that sooner.” The owner put the dagger into his pocket, patted his chest, and said, “Ask me anything, handsome. Nothing goes on here that I don’t know about.”
Han Sen didn’t think the man’s information was going to be very reliable. For a Baron, he was talking a big game. He didn’t look worried about giving away something that he shouldn’t.
Fortunately, Han Sen wasn’t hoping to learn any secrets. He just needed answers to some simple questions.
“What are you doing here?” Han Sen asked, looking around.
“Handsome, don’t you see? I’m here trying to earn money!” Alang laughed.
“Be serious; who cares if you earn money. I’m asking what everyone is doing here, on this planet!” Han Sen stared at Alang, already regretting asking the man for information. He was useless.
Alang looked as if he had woken from a dream, and he said, “Ah, you are asking about that? Why are you asking this? Aren’t you here for the same thing? Here to watch the Ancient Water God?”
Han Sen was surprised. There were stories of Water Gods in various races, but this one was special. And it was approved by the universe. Han Sen thought he had heard that this was a member of the Ancient God race.
“Is the funeral Miss Mirror mentioned the Ancient Water God’s funeral? No way. The legends of the Ancient Gods say that they are all born deified. And they live so long, with a lifespan of a billion years. It is rare to see one of the Ancient Gods dying,” Han Sen thought to himself.
Chapter 2348 Flu
“Is the Ancient Water God going to die soon?” Han Sen asked with a frown.
Alang’s eyes opened wide as he looked at Han Sen, and he said, “How could you say something like that? Aren’t you worried that the Ancient Water God will hear you and kill you?”
Han Sen was shocked and said, “I thought that is what you were suggesting.”
Alang rushed to blurt out, “At what point did I mention that the Ancient Water God was dying? I said we were here to watch the Ancient Water God level up and become a god spirit.”
“Level up to become a god spirit? Does such a level even exist?” Han Sen asked, his brows furrowing.
“It does, according to the legend. It is something that all who are deified aspire to. It has nothing to do with us vendors, though. We are merely here to just watch and rake in some cash.” Alang stopped and then glanced around. He quietly said, “But most creatures here seem to believe the Ancient Water God will fail. So, they are here to try their luck. They want the Ancient God Origin.”
“Ancient God Origin? What is that?” Han Sen asked, blinking.
Alang looked at Han Sen with shock and said, “Handsome, if you don’t know what an Ancient God Origin is, why are you even here?”
“That is business that doesn’t concern you. Hurry up and tell me what the Ancient God Origin is,” Han Sen said coldly.
Alang shrugged and said, “Ancient Gods exist differently than ordinary people and creatures. If one is born, then one must die. If one dies, then another will be born. Only when the older Ancient Gods die can there be a new one. In this universe, there is a fixed number of Ancient Gods. There cannot be any more or any less than a predetermined amount. If Ancient Water God fails to become a god spirit, he will leave behind an Ancient God Origin. That Ancient God Origin will turn into a new Ancient Water God, and it will be born deified.”
Alang paused and said, “The Ancient God Origin is just like the egg of another race. You need the same elemental powers to hatch it. If you get approved by the Ancient God Origin, it will follow you. To a water element creature, that is sure to be a grand servant.”
“Something that great actually exists? If I ate the Ancient God Origin, would I become deified?” Han Sen stroked his face as he spoke.
“Eat it?” Alang’s eyebrows looked like they were going to disappear into his hair. He peered at Han Sen as if he had just seen a ghost. A while later, he said, “Ancient Gods are born deified. They have scary amounts of power. Even if a deified was there, they could do nothing to an Ancient God Origin. Plus, the Ancient God have many deified elites already. They will be protecting it. They would not allow any other deifieds to get close to it.”
“You are right. But if a deified cannot eat it, that doesn’t mean that I couldn’t. This is a good opportunity for me. If I can nab the Ancient God Origin, I can nourish myself a great deal.” After saying that, Han Sen turned to leave, ignoring Alang.








Now Han Sen understood why Miss Mirror had brought him to watch the Ancient Water God become a god spirit. She probably wanted to see if Han Sen could get the Ancient God Origin. But Han Sen still didn’t know why Miss Mirror would want it.
As Han Sen walked, he suddenly had a cold chill. He sneezed and rubbed his nose, and he spoke to himself, “Who is missing?”
Han Sen continued walking away, but he did not see Alang gritting his teeth as he watched Han Sen walk away. The man’s eyeballs almost popped out of their sockets in his anger.
“How dare he want to eat my Ancient God Origin? Let’s see how you eat it while you’re dealing with this,” Alang snarled. His body spun around, and he and the items in his stall turned into water. He went into the sand, and then, he disappeared without a trace.
“Hachoo! Hachoo! Hachoo!” Han Sen kept on sneezing as if he had suddenly suffered the flu. He felt himself growing fevered, and snot oozed continually from his nose.
Han Sen didn’t feel good. He had the body of a Duke, and he had a King class Original Water King Body. How could he possibly get sick?
Han Sen used some of his power to look himself over. He didn’t detect anything unusual, but his body felt cold and a little dizzy. He sneezed and blew out snot. It looked as if he had come down with the flu.
When Han Sen went back to Miss Mirror’s peak, his body was so cold, and his head was spinning rapidly.
“What’s going on with you?” Miss Mirror frowned and looked at Han Sen.
“I don’t know... It’s like I have the flu...” Han Sen’s body was so cold. His head was burning, and it had been years since he had felt this way.
Miss Mirror’s face changed. She leaped over to Han Sen and placed a hand on his forehead. Han Sen felt power rush out of Miss Mirror’s hand and sweep into his body.
That power was icy cold, and when it went into Han Sen’s body, it quickly swirled around. It made Han Sen feel a bit better, but that sick feeling was still present.
“Where were you, and who did you encounter?” Miss Mirror’s face looked cold as she asked the question.
“I was over there, down in the markets. I just walked around and spoke to a stall owner.” Han Sen pointed to the market below them.
Miss Mirror wrapped an arm around Han Sen. She moved her body, and they suddenly teleported to the market.
Miss Mirror looked around and asked Han Sen, “Which stall owner?”
Han Sen struggled to fight off the dizziness. He brought Miss Mirror through the market to reach that corner.
“He was just here...” Han Sen’s face grew increasingly worried. Alang and the store were gone. He knew that must have happened when he left.
Han Sen was always careful. When he came up to the stall owner to ask his questions, he had already examined Alang. There was nothing strange about the man. Han Sen didn’t know where he had caught the sickness.
Fortunately, at that moment, aside from the flu-like symptoms, nothing bad was happening to his body.
“Huh, you dare to hide from me? Let us see who you really are!” Miss Mirror grunted. She raised her hand and pulled out an old mirror.
The old mirror faced Han Sen’s finger. The light in the mirror started to swirl into an image, and the image looked like an old video that was being rewound.
The video in the mirror was rewound very fast. All the items and creatures that were once there were now revealed clearly. It rewound to a few days before, but there was just an empty landscape.
“There really was a stall,” Han Sen said, when Miss Mirror turned to look at him. Han Sen stomach sank.
Miss Mirror frowned and said, “I would rather you were lying. If you aren’t lying, then you really did attract the attention of a very scary guy. Even my Space Mirror is unable to reveal any trace of him having been here. He must have been a very scary deified elite.”
Chapter 2349 Ancient Water God
They were unable to find Alang, so Miss Mirror brought Han Sen back to the peak. Fortunately, Han Sen only seemed to have a case of the flu. It wasn’t as big as a deal as it could have been.
Back on the peak, Miss Mirror had someone erect a tent for Han Sen so he could rest.
Han Sen felt incredibly dizzy. He didn’t try to fight through it and stay on his feet, though. He just slept beneath a blanket. It wasn’t as if he could challenge Miss Mirror, even if he wanted to. If the woman sought to bring him harm, he would be unable to fight back.
And no one could do anything to Han Sen since Miss Mirror was keeping watch over him. Plus, the blood kirin was happy to guard Han Sen’s tent. Thus, Han Sen was able to sleep soundly.
Because Han Sen felt so dizzy, it wasn’t long before he slipped into a sound sleep. He didn’t know how long he was asleep, but when he finally woke up, he felt considerably better. His symptoms had vanished.
He stretched and climbed out of the tent, then immediately froze.
He had gone to sleep in a tent atop a mountain, but now he climbed out onto a white beach. The tide was lapping against the shore only a few short meters away, the gentle waves breaking across the sand.
Han Sen turned around and realized he was on a small island. He could see every inch of the small island with just one pan of the head.
That island was no bigger than a baseball pitch, and two palm trees stood close by. The sight made Han Sen frown.
It was very surprising that someone had been able to teleport Han Sen there, especially under the watchful gaze of Miss Mirror. She was supremely powerful, after all.
Although Han Sen didn’t know the full extent of Miss Mirror’s powers, she was King Bai’s right hand. That had to be some sort of proof she was a beast.
The blood kirin was still standing guard outside the tent, but it seemed strangely calm. If it had been teleported away with him, and it showed no reaction.
While Han Sen was thinking, a wave that was a few hundred meters tall suddenly spawned in the sea. It came for the island like a mountain collapsing, and the roar it made sounded like the end of the world.
Han Sen’s stomach dropped, and he quickly used The Story of Genes. Because his body was so packed with Kingese, The Story of Genes was the only geno art he could run smoothly.








But the wave didn’t break across the island. It stopped in place, hovering right before the landmass. The water gathered up into the face of a giant sea god. It glared down on Han Sen, who was still on the island.
“Who are you? Why did you bring me here?” Han Sen asked the giant sea god thing.
“You don’t remember me?” the sea god growled.
Han Sen did think the face was rather familiar, so he looked closer. He soon noticed that the face that had been composed by that swelling of water was none other than Alang’s.
“Alang?” Han Sen was surprised.
“I am the alpha of water. I am Ancient Water God.” The sea god’s voice sounded like a tsunami. The sky changed color, and a harsh wind blew, making Han Sen’s clothes flap madly. The volume was so loud, Han Sen felt as if his eardrums would rupture.
“You are Ancient Water God?” Han Sen was frozen. He seemed to remember that he had told Alang he was going to eat the Water God Origin.
“No wonder Alang’s expression looked so weird when I said that, because...” Han Sen wanted to slap himself. He wished he hadn’t said something so stupid out loud; those were thoughts that he really should have kept to his inner-ramblings. Han Sen knew wallowing in regret would be pointless now, though. He coughed twice to Ancient Water God and said, “Mister God, please don’t be mad. I was only kidding around.”
“You were joking?” Ancient Water God made an expression that was almost like a smile, but not quite.
“Yeah, it was just a joke.” Han Sen nodded. He kept casting The Story of Genes. He wasn’t arrogant enough to think he could withstand the might of a deified being.
Now, he could only think about running. Luckily, Ancient Water God was on the verge of becoming a god spirit. Han Sen needed to escape back to the sanctuary, wait until the deified died as he tried to level up, then come back after.
The worst thing was, Han Sen’s body was too full of Kingese to cast the Blood-Pulse Sutra. He couldn’t use his Blood-Pulse Powers to return to the sanctuary.
“Allow me to continue the joke,” Ancient Water God said. His body shattered and became a heavy storm. It was going to drown the entire island.

The water poured down around Han Sen, soaking his clothes. He looked like a wet chicken, but he wasn’t injured. The Ancient Water God hadn’t put any power into the water, so it just felt like a particularly intense rainstorm.
“I was just talking. I didn’t actually do anything. You don’t have to be this mad at me,” Han Sen said, feeling frustrated.
Boom!
Ancient Water God didn’t appear again, but something exploded through the water not too far away. A silver dragon had emerged from the sea, and its silver light gleamed like the glory of the sun. Silver rain showered from the creature, and its presence was pretty terrifying.
Roar!
The silver-winged dragon roared into the air, and its silver king area spread to cover everything in sight. Han Sen’s body felt as if it was stuck in the mud, and he could barely move.
The silver-winged dragon opened its enormous mouth, revealing silver light that looked like a swirling galaxy. It was going to consume Han Sen’s body.
The silver-winged dragon came to consume Han Sen, and he found himself standing right in front of its gaping maw, no larger than one of the dragon’s teeth.
In the silver-winged dragon’s king area, Han Sen found it hard to move. He wouldn’t be able to avoid the silver-winged dragon’s attack. As The Story of Genes continued to run, he reached out and wrapped both of his hands around one of the dragon’s teeth. It was like two bulls colliding, and he tried to stop the silver-wing dragon.
The silver-wing dragon’s weight slammed into Han Sen, pushing him down into the sea.
Han Sen held tightly to the dragon tooth as his body was shoved deeper and deeper into the water. He couldn’t stop the beast.
Han Sen ran The Story of Genes as hard as it would go, attempting to shove back the silver-winged power.
As the dragon plunged through the water, it created a substantial backdraft. If Han Sen let go, he would be pulled into the dragon’s mouth.

The silver-winged dragon was scary. Han Sen struggled to keep his grip on the dragon tooth, but the water pummeled his body constantly. He trembled under the force, and he felt as if his arms were going to get ripped off by the power.
Boom!
Suddenly, Han Sen’s body was shining gold. Gold light beamed from every inch of his body, interspersed with tiny symbols.
Because of the silver-winged dragon’s attack, the Kingese inside of him had activated.
The gold Kingese cycled furiously through his body, making Han Sen feel as if an endless amount of power was now coursing through his veins. The scariest thing was, it felt like everything in existence was lending him power. Mountain and valley, sun and moon, and every plant in existence were all fueling Han Sen’s strength.

Chapter 2350 Water God Level Up
Katcha!
The gold light spun. Han Sen’s hands were so strong that he managed to pull two of the dragon’s teeth right out.
The silver-winged dragon raised its head and shrieked. Blood gushed from the gaps of the missing teeth. The dragon blood diffused into the sea, dying that portion of the water red.
Han Sen was now holding two dragon teeth in his hands. He swam through the water toward the dragon again, then threw the two broken-off teeth into the dragon’s belly.
The silver-winged dragon curled its body in pain at the blow. It really wanted to bite Han Sen, but when it lowered its head, a gold fist smacked into its jaw.
The dragon’s huge body was sent soaring away with the force of the punch. It floundered through the air, still writhing in pain.
Han Sen looked at what his fist had done, and he could scarcely believe it. His power was so strong when it combined with the power of the Kingese. He had managed to break the silver dragon’s king area with a punch and send the beast flying.
A powerful King creature didn’t stand a chance in rivaling Han Sen’s newfound strength. It was difficult to imagine how strong he had become under the buffing of the Kingese.
As a Ghana woman was sailing over the ocean, the surface of the water suddenly exploded in front of her. The water fountained up like a spring, and a silver dragon flew out of the sea, screaming. Its body was twisted and bleeding all over.
Xius’ face paled. “That’s a silver-winged dragon, a King class xenogeneic!”
Before Xius could compose a second thought, a gold shadow emerged from the water in pursuit of the dragon.
The gold shadow chased after the silver-winged dragon, throwing punches with blinding speed and power. The dragon was taking a pummeling from pure physical power.
The dragon’s silver king area was ripped apart by the attacker’s fists like a soap bubble being popped. The silver-winged dragon’s blood and scales were flying everywhere. Sharp cracking sounds echoed over the water as the dragon’s bones started to break.
Katcha!








With its bare hands, the gold shadow ripped the dragon’s head off its body. The beast’s blood sprayed across the sky and descended like rain.
“Han Sen!” When Xius got a better look at the attacker, her eyes widened in surprise.
When she met Han Sen among the Dragons, he could barely fight Dragon Nine. Now, he had just killed a silver-winged dragon with his bare hands. That was unexpected, to say the least.
“Xenogeneic King hunted: Silver-Wing Dragon. Xenogeneic gene found. Obtained Silver-Winged Dragon beast soul.”
Han Sen was left clutching the dragon’s head. He punched and the dragon’s skull cracked open, revealing a draconic orb that fell into Han Sen’s hand. It was the silver-wing dragon’s xenogeneic gene.
Han Sen put away the dragon orb and looked over at Xius. He looked happy.
The Kingese started to fade, and Han Sen moved over to Xius.
“Long time no see, Han Sen. I can’t believe you have become this strong,” Xius said, her voice friendly but her body slightly tense.
“You have the wrong person. I am Bai Yi, Sixteenth Prince of the Extreme King,” Han Sen said harshly.
Xius looked surprised. She looked up at Han Sen with evident confusion.
Han Sen didn’t explain anything further, and he asked Xius, “Why are you here? Have you seen any other creatures about?”
Ancient Water God had brought Han Sen there, summoned a water dragon, then disappeared. Han Sen had no clue where he currently was.
Xius shook her head. “Ancient Water God showed himself. He is going to level up to become a god spirit in Half-Star Bay. Everyone in the vicinity is headed there, but I’ve come all this way and I haven’t seen anyone.”
“Half-Star Bay?” Han Sen frowned, as he didn’t know anything about the place.
“I am going there right now. If you’re willing to come, Prince Sixteen, we can travel there together,” Xius offered.
“Okay.” Han Sen nodded.
“Why are you here, prince?” Xius didn’t believe his claim that he wasn’t Han Sen, but she also didn’t challenge him on it. When she spoke to him, she referred to him as Prince Sixteen.
“I was just out for a nice swim.” Han Sen had no intention of explaining how the Ancient Water God had dragged him out there.
After pausing, Han Sen asked, “There are so many creatures here that are hoping the Ancient Water God will fail. Won’t that make him angry?”
Xius smiled and said, “Ancient Water God is known as the God of Life. He never kills. People here are happy to watch him ascend, and it’s not as if people are going to disturb his leveling up process. He won’t get mad.”
Han Sen thought to himself, “Ancient God is an interesting race. If I had p*ssed off any other deified elite, they definitely would have killed me. He left me out there and sent a silver-winged dragon after me once I woke up, but it seems that he didn’t really want me dead.”
Han Sen traveled with Xius all the way back to Half-Star Bay. As they approached, they noticed giant waves rolling across the sea. The waves were so high that they seemed to soar across the sky like dragons, and they got taller and taller as time went on.
The clouds seemed to rip apart, reducing to whiffs of nothing. In fact, dimensions were twisting across the entire planet, and strange scenes unfolded everywhere Han Sen looked.
“We are too late in reaching Half-Star Bay. Ancient Water God is already in the middle of leveling up to become a god spirit.” Xius sighed. They pulled to a stop.
Han Sen kept watching the twisted sky. It looked like something was about to appear in the twisted clouds.
The wavy seas suddenly all surged in one direction. A giant body was forming on the horizon, pulling its mass from the seawater.

All the water on the planet was being drawn to Ancient Water God, and his body swelled bigger and bigger.
The endless sea dried up quickly, leaving the creatures in the ocean gasping on the dry seabed. Without water, their death came in minutes. Ancient Water God’s body stood so tall that it looked like it was holding the sky. The massive figure turned its head up, looking at the sky above.
“Water is life. It is at the basis of everything. I am an ancient spirit. I am the god of water. I crush the world in the name of the water, and I will earn the body of a god spirit.” Ancient Water God’s voice echoed far beyond the planet he stood on. Throughout the universe, wherever there was water, the Ancient God’s power began to flow. It was like all the sources of water were giving their powers to him, right then and there.
The water of the universe was now all moving, headed for Ancient Water God’s body, strengthening him. The terrifying sight made many King class beings want to kowtow before him.
Boom!
The fabric of space was torn, and an old and mysterious palace was revealed. When it emerged, the water of the galaxy came to a stop. Every drop of water that was going to Ancient Water God hovered in place.
“The geno hall?” Han Sen was shocked. It was the second time he had seen the geno hall. The last time he saw it was when Kong Fei started a war.
