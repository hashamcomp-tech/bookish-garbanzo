  <p> Chapter 2351 Breaking the Door
While Han Sen was staring at the geno hall, the black crystal armor inside his Sea of Soul suddenly released a mysterious substance. It wrapped around Han Sen, covering him completely. After that, Han Sen couldn’t even detect his own presence. It was as if he didn’t exist.
Han Sen quickly thought back to the time with Kong Fei. “When the geno hall appeared previously, the black crystal armor did something similar to this. Is the black crystal armor connected to the geno hall? Or is it simply afraid of the geno hall?”
While Han Sen pondered this, he heard Ancient Water God roaring to the sky. “I have the name Water God! I am the alpha of water! I am going to become the Water God Spirit, and no one can stop me!”
When Ancient Water God roared to the sky, the water that had been suppressed by the geno hall began flowing toward him again. It was like a bunch of stars amassing in Ancient Water God’s body.
As the additional water strengthened him, Ancient Water God’s body grew powerful enough to tear the fabric of space into shreds. His enormous form rose, heading for the geno hall.
Han Sen stared up blankly. Ancient Water God’s power must have been practically endless to have reached such a high level. His body was unimaginably large, and it drowned the nearby planets as it moved. Seawater was the only thing visible in any direction.
Han Sen looked to the sky and saw that even the sky had been overtaken by water. And yet somehow, above that ocean, the mysterious geno hall was still visible.
“Ancient God is scary,” Han Sen thought with trepidation. He had seen many deified elites since coming to the geno universe, but this was the first time he had ever seen destructive power on such a massive scale.
If Ancient Water God wanted to kill, he could destroy an entire system within the space of a second. No living creature could block that sort of power.
Xius looked up with wide eyes, and she said, “Ancient Gods are born deified, and their lifespan is a billion years. Few creatures can ever hope to rival the Ancient God in this universe.”
Boom!
A loud noise boomed above them, forming massive waves on the surface of the hovering water. Then, a heavy rain was unleashed. A shockwave rolled out from the water, shaking the mountains as it brushed their peaks.
Han Sen and Xius were blasted away by the scary shockwave that had been released. It was as if they were struggling against the rush of a tsunami, but their efforts were futile. They were tossed aside like ants.
Pang!










Han Sen’s body hit a mountainside, and the peak collapsed. Blood trickled from Han Sen’s mouth. He used all his power to repel the force, but he couldn’t hold back the overwhelming shockwave. He couldn’t even stand up straight.
Boom!
Another shockwave rolled across the sky, and lots of heavy rain followed in its wake. The rain slammed down like a tsunami, shoving Han Sen back even further.
As the blows slammed into Han Sen and damaged his organs, they triggered the Kingese. Shining gold symbols appeared across Han Sen’s flesh, making him far stronger. Han Sen regained his feet against the force pressing down on him.
Xius hit the bottom of the sea and was pressed into the mud with the dying ocean creatures. She was about to be buried inside a crevice that appeared in the bedrock.
Han Sen frowned. He broke through the tsunami-like shockwave and raced next to Xius to pull her out of the crevice and the sea.
He grabbed Xius and looked up into the sky. The turmoil and heavy rain that followed obscured his vision, casting the entire planet into chaos. He couldn’t see anything.
Ancient Water God was still roaring above him, and he heard the sounds of big waves hitting space. The impacts seemed strong enough to make the stars themselves rattle and shake. Countless mountains were crumbling under the onslaught.
This level of power was far beyond what Han Sen could comprehend. With the protection of the Kingese, Han Sen barely managed to stay upright in the storm. He stood atop a big rock, looking up at the sky. He wanted to know what Ancient Water God was doing, but he couldn’t see past the wall of rain.
Xius was close to becoming a King, but she could only hide in the shelter provided by Han Sen’s stalwart body. She held onto him tightly to avoid getting pulled into the bottom of the sea again.
The whole universe appeared to be shaking under that tumultuous sea. Ancient Water God’s voice resounded throughout the universe with deafening volume.
Han Sen couldn’t see the actual battle, but he could hear in Ancient Water God’s roar that the creature was fighting. It sounded like the Ancient God was putting everything he had into the fight.
Pang!
Suddenly, Han Sen heard a strange sound, like a stone door grinding open. A light shone through the air.
That light beamed through the water above, cutting clean through all of the chaos. Han Sen had been nearly blind earlier, but now he could clearly see through the storm.
That light didn’t seem to be at full strength, though. It was as if someone had pushed open a door to let the light of a flickering candlestick seep out.
“The geno hall’s door has opened.” The water kept smacking Han Sen in the face, but he was still able to see what was happening clearly. That light was coming from the geno hall’s door, which had been pushed open a little.
“I am a god spirit, and no one can stop me!” Ancient Water God kept roaring. His enormous body was trying to force its way into the gap of the geno hall’s door.
“Did he succeed?” With the Purple-Eye Butterfly running in his right eye, Han Sen was staring at the geno hall’s door.
He didn’t know exactly how someone became a god spirit, but judging from what Ancient Water God was doing, Han Sen could guess that the Ancient God was making his way into the geno hall. Perhaps if he entered the hall, he would become a god spirit.
A thousand races had lanterns there, but they were just lanterns. Entering the geno hall as an individual was a different matter. Only a race’s geno lantern could reside in the hall.
Now, Ancient Water God was trying to force his body into the geno hall. He wanted to go in, but it wasn’t clear what would happen if he succeeded.
The enormous body pressed against the door, waves continually slamming into its surface. The water was going to rush into the hall at any second.
But suddenly, Han Sen saw a hand emerge from the gap of the ajar geno hall door.
That hand was so beautiful. The moment the hand emerged from beyond that gap, it pressed against Ancient Water God’s body and drove him back.
Then the hand vanished behind the door again. The geno hall’s door shut. The sea hung above them, perfectly still, and the storm stopped.

The door was closed, and the light was gone. Han Sen was now unable to see the geno hall. All he could see was that blue sea that had taken over the sky.
The next second, a red dye began to spread through the water. It opened like a flower. In moments, the water in the sky had become a sea of blood.
With a boom, the bloody sea collapsed. A rain of blood poured down, covering everything in crimson.


Chapter 2352 Ancient God Origin
“A creature that terrifying lives in the geno hall?” Han Sen felt a chill prickle his skin. The hideously powerful Ancient Water God had been killed by little more than a slap.
The black crystal armor’s behavior worried Han Sen, but he tried not to let it show. The armor was probably connected to the creature inside the geno hall, he surmised. If the armor was discovered, Han Sen could not fathom the consequences he might have to endure.
The Ancient Water God had been killed by a single blow. Han Sen would be annihilated by a small fraction of that force. He would probably be crushed into jelly.
The Ancient Water God’s blood rained down on everything around them. The blood rushed into the sea, giving the dying creatures another chance at life. The oceans filled in once more, albeit in a bloodier hue.
Han Sen noticed the green growth as small plants spread across the nearby rocks, and he allowed the blood rain to fall on him. The rain soaked his clothes, and it felt like lifeforce was falling directly onto his skin. He also detected traces of the Ancient Water God’s presence. It was quite faint, however.
Most of the creatures on that planet were primitive, with only a few xenogeneics among them. With the blood rain’s nourishment, though, the ordinary creatures started to change. Their genes were upgraded, and they evolved into lower class xenogeneics immediately.
Although they were at the bottom of the food chain, they had been given the opportunity to grow.
“Ancient Water God failed after all?” Xius sighed.
That result was actually expected. Many elites from the Ancient God, Very High, and Extreme King had failed in the past.
“Where is the Ancient God Origin?” Han Sen searched through the rain. He couldn’t see anything that might resemble an Ancient God Origin.
Xius said, “Ancient Water God leaked the news about his own attempt to ascend. He wanted to attract water element elites so that if he failed, one of those elites could carry on with his Ancient God Origin. He must have selected someone before he tried to ascend. The Ancient God Origin will most likely be inside the person or creature he selected. Perhaps in a few hundred years, there will be a new Ancient Water God.”
Han Sen nodded. He didn’t think he stood a chance. Given how badly he had p*ssed off Ancient Water God, he was lucky the Ancient God hadn’t killed him. It was unlikely he’d be given the Ancient God Origin.
As Han Sen was deep in thought, something fell from the sky in the blood rain. It began to curve as it fell, heading directly toward them like a meteor.
Han Sen was shocked. The wall of water came to a standstill directly before Han Sen. It turned into a water tornado that danced around him in a slow circle.








“The Ancient God Origin!” Xius whispered hoarsely.
Han Sen stared at it in shock. Despite the grudge between him and Ancient Water God, the deified had actually given him the Ancient God Origin. It didn’t seem possible.
The water flew around Han Sen a few times, taking a shape that vaguely resembled a dragon. It spoke to Han Sen quietly, then went to rest in his right hand.
Han Sen opened his hand as the water drop fell into his palm. It became a water orb that looked rather like an egg. It solidified pretty quickly, turning into a perfect crystal orb.
The crystal orb had a watery pattern on it. As the orb touched Han Sen’s skin, his Original Water King Body reacted. The Original Water King Body had previously been affected by the Kingese, but now it was erupting like a volcano under the vibrations of the crystal orb.
Han Sen was so happy. If the mere vibrations of the Ancient God Origin could help his Original Water King Body, then crystal orb was even stronger than Han Sen had realized. If he could eat it, perhaps the Original Water King Body could level up.
Because Han Sen had used the Blood-Pulse Sutra to refine the Original Water King Body, it didn’t consume any of his energy. Thus, the Original Water King Body would remain at the first tier of King class, which was as far as Bai Yi had developed it. It would be incredibly difficult for Han Sen to level it up further.
But the crystal orb’s power blended into the Original Water King Body, and under that power, the Original Water King Body had a bit of a breakthrough.
Han Sen didn’t have time to explore all the potential uses of the water orb, for he soon saw a few shadows headed his way. They must have belonged to the people and creatures in the vicinity. They had seen the Ancient God Origin descend in that direction, so they had come looking for it.
Han Sen hid his crystal orb, but it was too late. The shadows were approaching rapidly, and after they saw Han Sen, they swooped in to attack him without saying a word.
The King class elite leading the charge activated his water area around Han Sen, then sent a slap toward him. The attack was nowhere near the power displayed by Ancient Water God, but it was enough to throw up some tumultuous waves.
The other attacking elites also possessed water powers. Elites who had affinities to other elements wouldn’t benefit very much from the Ancient God Origin.
Han Sen coldly grunted. He activated his Original Water King Body, instantly releasing his own king area. He threw a punch towards the King class elite.
The two king areas collided, and the attacker’s third tier area was suppressed by Han Sen’s first tier area. The rival king area cracked immediately.
Pang!
Han Sen broke the enemy’s king area, then thrust his hand forward, driving it right through the enemy King’s chest.
They were both using water powers, but normal King class elites lacked the bodies of the Extreme King.
The other elites coming to attack Han Sen stopped, shocked by his violent display of strength. They pulled back slightly, not daring to come any closer.
If they wouldn’t come to him, then Han Sen would go to them instead. He cut down three Kings in under a second. People were as infuriated as they were shocked.
“The Original Water King Body is too strong!” shouted a voice. But as everyone else ran away, Han Sen saw someone emerging from the blood rain. They were holding an umbrella, and they exuded a smothering sense of pressure that was now bearing down on Han Sen.
“Thousand Chance Umbrella... It’s the Pirates’ Nine-Headed Bird!” someone screamed out loud.
Han Sen focused his gaze on the newcomer, turning his back on the elites who were now running away.
The newcomer moved with deceptive slowness. At least a hundred miles separated the person from Han Sen, but the newcomer crossed that distance in only a few steps. Their umbrella was raised. They looked at Han Sen and smiled.
When Han Sen saw the person’s face, he could tell it was a very ordinary one. But while the slender face was unremarkable, the eyes were beautiful. They were like two crescent moons.
Han Sen didn’t know anything about this “Nine-Headed Bird,” but Han Sen could tell that they were King class from the energy they were emitting. They might have even been half-deified.
The Nine-Headed Bird stopped. They looked at Han Sen through the blood rain and smiled. “Prince Sixteen Bai Yi, am I correct?”

“You know it is me, and you still dare to approach? You are brave!” Han Sen growled.
“We Pirates have never lacked guts.” The Nine-Headed Bird stopped smiling, and their expression became unreadable. “So, leave your Ancient God Origin behind and get lost. Either that, or I’ll have to call King Bai to come pick up your dead body.”



Chapter 2353 Nine-Headed Bird
“Ridiculous!” Han Sen shouted, pretending to be angry. He used his king area to cover Nine-Headed Bird.
The water area shrouded Nine-Headed Bird, turning into a rain of water that restricted Nine-Headed Bird’s body.
Nine-Headed Bird didn’t move. He stood still with the umbrella open, and he allowed Han Sen’s water area to restrict his body.
“Why haven’t you moved?” Han Sen asked with a frown.
“I am afraid,” Nine-Headed Bird said coldly.
“Afraid of what?” Han Sen asked.
“I am afraid my strikes will be too fast, and you will be killed too soon. It isn’t like I am afraid of the Extreme King. You’re nothing more than a nuisance,” Nine-Headed Bird said in a calm voice.
Han Sen laughed and said, “In this world, everything has a cost. If you ever find something that is truly free, please let me know.”
“You are right. Although Pirates are never at a disadvantage, it’s rare to find something as valuable as that orb. I might not ever find anything like it again. I’m not afraid of going to some trouble to obtain the Ancient God Origin.” Nine-Headed Bird smiled darkly. His swordlight lit up, cutting through Han Sen’s king area immediately. The swordlight surrounded his body, holding back Han Sen’s water area.
“You are half-deified.” Han Sen looked at him.
Nine-Headed Bird approached Han Sen, striding through Han Sen’s king area as if it was nothing. An ominous swordlight glowed from his umbrella as he got close to Han Sen.
“I am half-deified, and you only have a first tier king area. You might think that I will hesitate to bully someone so weak, but we Pirates are not afraid of looking like the bad guys,” Nine-Headed Bird said. He closed the umbrella and thrust it towards Han Sen like a rapier.
The swordlight looked rather simple on the surface, but there was a hidden swordmind in the strike. It hid the strike’s true depth.
Han Sen used his Original Water King Body and his body became water. He shot toward Nine-Headed Bird like a water dragon.










Han Sen was driving toward Nine-Headed Bird’s body. Nine-Headed Bird’s umbrella, which looked like a sword, suddenly opened again. Han Sen’s watery form slammed into it.
Pang!
Han Sen was thrown back. His water body returned to a humanoid shape, and he was about to leap toward Nine-Headed Bird again when a swordlight came down on him. The strike had been perfectly hidden, and Han Sen didn’t see it until it crushed his body.
The water that had composed Han Sen’s body shivered, trying to gather itself up again, but something was keeping it from drawing together. Because of this, it remained spread in puddles, shaking and twitching.
Nine-Headed Bird lifted his umbrella and smiled. “My Split-Day swordlight can’t destroy your Original Water King Body, but I can keep your body from drawing together again. It might not kill you, but it can seal you for ten thousand years. Prince Sixteen, you should just give me the Ancient God Origin. That will save us both the trouble.”
As he finished his threat, Nine-Headed Bird suddenly frowned. Han Sen’s water had begun shining gold. Every drop of water had a gold Kingese flickering inside it.
Katcha!
Countless waterdrops regathered, and the hidden swordlight that had suppressed Han Sen was now crushed. The shape of a human reformed in front of Nine-Headed Bird.
Nine-Headed Bird squinted at Han Sen in surprise. “Your body contains that much Kingese? How did you do that?”
Han Sen didn’t speak. The Kingese of his body were quivering. His bones were roaring and shaking. He punched towards Nine-Headed Bird.
When he punched, although there was no power in the thrust, he had the support of the ground and the sky. Everything in that world was shaking under the weight of the Kingese. He got a quiet response.
Nine-Headed Bird’s face turned grim. He put away his umbrella and gathered up his sword mind. The sword was aimed at Han Sen’s fist.
He struck, but at first, there was no swordlight.
Pang!
As the two strikes collided, gold light and swordlights went everywhere. Countless swordlights fell like rain toward Han Sen, sometimes making it all the way to his skin before the Kingese would flicker and ping them away.
The fist and the umbrella ground against each other. The powerful half-deified was sent flying away under the force of Han Sen’s punch. His umbrella was bent backwards like a bowl.
Incredible power surged through Han Sen’s legs, and he chased after the arc of Nine-Headed Bird, still throwing punches as he went.
Han Sen’s attacks were like sea waves, getting heavier and heavier. The power of each punch was stronger than the last. When Han Sen had seen Ancient Water God’s shocking water power, he had immediately realized that he could combine it with the Extreme King’s Shocking Sky Punch.
Nine-Headed Bird’s face changed. He kept trying to dodge away from the string of attacks, but no matter how unexpectedly he tried to move, the world answered to the beck and call of the Kingese rattling inside Han Sen’s body. Nine-Headed Bird couldn’t escape now that Han Sen had locked onto him.
Pang! Pang! Pang!
The fist and the umbrella kept coming against each other in the sky. In just a few punches, the King class item was broken under Han Sen’s fist.
“Sh*t! Shouldn’t you have called that the Battle God King Body? This is so f*cking ridiculous!” Nine-Headed Bird kept shouting as he fought.
He was a half-deified being, but he was using every ounce of his power to hold off Han Sen. And still, Han Sen had him at a severe disadvantage. His bones were cracking, and it sounded like they were going to snap.
Xius and the others were watching the two fight in the sky. As she watched the gold shadow slowly beating the sh*t out of Nine-Headed Bird, she was very surprised.
“No wonder the Extreme King are one of the top three races. Nine-Headed Bird of the Pirate is very strong, but he still cannot go against someone with the blood of the Extreme King.”
“That king area, at its first tier, is suppressing the half-deified Nine-Headed Bird. The Extreme King are scary!”

...
Nine-Headed Bird, upon hearing these comments, became furious. He knew that Han Sen was much weaker than him, but the Kingese powering Han Sen’s body were simply too powerful. The whole universe and all its creatures were answering to Han Sen. His every punch was combined with the power of the sky and the ground. It was enough to surpass Nine-Headed Bird’s own power.
Nine-Headed Bird was punched in the face. He was sent flying away again, sputtering in anger. “F*ck you! If I don’t attack with everything I have, you’ll think I’m nothing more than a housecat. Time to show you that I’m a tiger.”
He shook his arms, and a black light glowed out of his body. His arms became black wings as his body began to swell. He became a disturbing black bird.
The weird bird looked like a dark cloud with nine heads. The eyes had gold lights within them, and its claws carried clouds. When the bird flapped his wings, wind and fire were summoned. It rose overhead like some demon of the apocalypse.
As Han Sen’s punches rolled across the sky like waves, the Nine-Headed Bird released a strange, vibrating scream. That sound could break stone, and the sky seemed to tear under the weight of the voice. The bird’s talons fell to intercept Han Sen’s fist.
Pang!
The fist and the talons collided with each other, but this time, it was Han Sen who was blown backward. The Nine-Headed Bird flapped its wings and dove after him. The bird kept screeching weirdly, its eyes like thunder.
Han Sen prepared to move forward and attack again, but the Nine-Headed Bird just hovered in the air. All nine of its heads were making strange sounds, like a demon mumbling. As the mumbled chant continued, a weird black area covered the region.



Chapter 2354 Suppress Demon Coffin
Han Sen walked toward the Nine-Headed Bird. Darkness flowed from the creature, consuming all that could be seen in every direction. Han Sen knew that the darkness was coming for him, that it would trap his body in less than a second.
Pang!
Han Sen hit the darkness, but it was like he was striking a plate of steel. The impact made his hand go numb, and the wall of black around him remained unmoved.
The darkness seemed to solidify into walls of flat stone. It enveloped the entire area around Han Sen, trapping him inside a small box.
Han Sen kept punching the black stone around him, his Kingese continuing to shine. But even so, the black stone didn’t break. Dark demonic symbols began to appear across the surface of the stone.
“The sky above has a bird of nine heads, and hell below holds the suppressing demon coffin. No matter how strong your Kingese body is, you cannot escape the binding area of my demon coffin.” Nine-Headed Bird’s voice sounded in Han Sen’s ear.
Han Sen examined the demonic symbols across the stone. One of them looked rather like a bird’s head, and it turned and squawked at him.
Xius and the other observers saw the black coffin close around Han Sen. The pitch-black coffin was disturbing to look at, and a nine-headed bird stood on its lid. Each of the bird’s nine heads looked off in a different direction, and it kept the coffin suppressed. A demonic air swirled around the coffin, and no matter how Han Sen tried to attack, the demon coffin would not budge.
Han Sen’s fist kept striking, but he couldn’t break through the suppressing field of the demon coffin.
The demonic symbols flashed across the coffin’s interior, and a bird head appeared again. The weird bird eyes stared at Han Sen and the creature chuckled. “Don’t waste your breath. My Suppress Demon Coffin can bind both gods and demons. Even if a deified was in your place, they wouldn’t be able to break out of this coffin. You can hand over the Ancient God Origin now. If you don’t, and the Suppress Demon Coffin falls into the demonic abyss, even I won’t be able to help you out.”
Han Sen ignored the bird. He kept punching against the Suppress Demon Coffin, but it was proving to be futile. Han Sen’s power slammed uselessly into the demon coffin’s walls. There was a power, like an abyssal one, absorbing his strikes. He was unable to hurt the demon coffin.
Han Sen summoned his Purple-Eye Butterfly. He had a look at the demon coffin, and he learned that the demon coffin wasn’t a solid item. Instead, it was being continually formed and fueled by power coming from the demonic abyss. It was connected to that abyssal and demonic world. Furthermore, the coffin was now slowly falling into that place of darkness.
The Suppress Demon Coffin’s demonic air had grown strong, continually replenished by the streams of darkness coming from the bird’s nine heads. The eyes of the fiend were unleashing a demon light, which seemed to be making a path for the demon coffin.
The demon coffin was slowly descending into the dark as tentacles made from a dark substance pulled it down. Just as Nine-Headed Bird had said, not even a deified would be able to escape once they fell into that dark abyss.








“Prince Sixteen, you are so talented. You also have the protection of the Kingese. You could achieve so much. Why throw away your life for the Ancient God Origin? You will live a long and good life, surrounded by many beautiful women. You will reign over all of the Extreme King. Dying is not worth it,” said the bird’s head in a tempting tone. It had emerged from the coffin walls again.
Han Sen found it annoying, so he punched it. The bird’s head vanished back into the coffin, and Han Sen’s power was absorbed by the stone walls.
Han Sen’s head spun with thoughts. “This demon coffin area is so weird. I’m afraid ordinary power cannot break it. The Kingese are strong, but they are still combined with my flesh, which means I cannot control them. I cannot cast the Kingese beyond my skin. Relying on the power of the Kingese to break the demon coffin’s area will be pointless.”
“Nine-Headed Bird, if I go into the demonic abyss, this item will be useless for you, too. You will lose the Ancient God Origin, and you will also become an enemy of the Extreme King. Do you want to be killed?” Han Sen said.
“Others might be afraid of you and the Extreme King, but we Pirates are not. You should just hand me the Ancient God Origin while you’re ahead. Otherwise, you’re going to be buried in the demonic abyss. Extreme King or not, it does not matter to me,” Nine-Headed Bird laughed sinisterly.
Han Sen didn’t move, and he said, “Unless the Very High were supporting you, the Pirates wouldn’t dare to go against the Extreme King by themselves. You need to think about this. I’m carrying thousands of Kingese. I’m a genius unlike any the Extreme King have ever had. Father really loves me. If you bury me in the demonic abyss, what do you think my father will do? Do you think the Very High will fight the whole of the Extreme King on your behalf?”
Nine-Headed Bird went quiet, then hissed, “Do not talk crap! Give me your Ancient God Origin if you want to live. Otherwise, even if King Bai himself came here, you would still die in the demonic abyss.”
“I’m very bad-tempered. I only respond to the nice cop. Trying to intimidate me like this will never make me hand over the Ancient God Origin, no matter how dire my circumstances might be.” Han Sen paused, and then said, “But if you want to make a wager with me, and I lose, I will give you the Ancient God Origin.”
Nine-Headed Bird frowned and asked, “What are you proposing?”
“You have used the Suppress Demon Coffin to trap me. This is nothing. You and I stand here without dodging. You punch me, and I punch you. Whoever moves first loses. That will test the real mettle of a man. If I lose, I will give you the Ancient God Origin,” Han Sen said.
Nine-Headed Bird’s eyes flashed. He gave Han Sen a look of scorn and said, “You have the Kingese body, which makes you stronger than my half-deified body. Why would I agree to this wager?”
“I won’t use the power of the Kingese. If I use the Kingese power, I also lose,” Han Sen said.
“Are you serious?” Nine-Headed Bird’s eyes flashed. He was staring at Han Sen as he spoke.
“I promise in King Bai’s good name. If I break my promise, then King Bai will die,” Han Sen said.
When Nine-Headed Bird heard Han Sen use King Bai’s name to make the promise, he believed him. He still harbored some suspicion, though. “I’m willing to make this gamble. But I will have to hit you first. If you move or use your Kingese, then you lose.”
“Sure,” Han Sen answered quickly.
Nine-Headed Bird, hearing Han Sen answer him so quickly, grew even more suspicious. After a moment of thought, he said, “We can only use our own power to fight. We cannot make use of xenogeneic treasures.”
Han Sen’s face paled slightly. He cocked an eyebrow and said, “Isn’t it normal to make use of xenogeneic treasures?”
Nine-Headed Bird grinned widely. “Using xenogeneic treasures is worse than using king areas. You don’t like my Suppress Demon Coffin area, yet you insist on xenogeneic treasures?”
“About that...” Han Sen’s face still looked worried.
“Hurry up and make your decision. The Suppress Demon Coffin is on the verge of falling into the demonic abyss. If you do not decide now, then you won’t be able to turn back.” Nine-Headed Bird laughed again.
“Sure. I agree, but I will have to take the first swing.” Han Sen could see that the Suppress Demon Coffin was teetering on the edge of the demonic abyss, and it made him grit his teeth.
“No, I will hit first,” Nine-Headed Bird replied instantly.
Han Sen’s face kept changing, and he didn’t speak. A scary demonic air had made its way inside the Suppress Demon Coffin. The coffin warped, and the tentacle-like strand of demonic power was feeling its way forward, coming for Han Sen.
“Fine. We agree, then!” Han Sen screamed when he saw the dark, demonic tentacle reaching out lecherously to touch him.
“Heehee, that is it, then.” Nine-Headed Bird snickered. The Suppress Demon Coffin then opened and Han Sen emerged.

Suppress Demon Coffin was consumed by darkness as the black tentacles surged up around it and pulled it down into the black.

Chapter 2355 Dragon Beast Soul
Han Sen floated down until his feet rested on the surface of the water. He had no plans to escape. He looked at Nine-Headed Bird and said, “I will remain standing here. You can use whatever sort of power you wish, and if my feet cause any ripples in the water, then I forfeit and lose.”
When Nine-Headed Bird heard Han Sen’s declaration, he drifted down to the sea’s surface as well. His bird-with-nine-heads appearance returned to something human-like again. He smiled and said, “As I should have expected from a prince of the Extreme King: you are true to your word.”
“I don’t know if you Pirates are trustworthy, but the Extreme King are,” Han Sen coldly said.
Nine-Headed Bird smiled and said, “There is no need to try to provoke me. If you keep your end of the bargain, I will not break the rules.”
“Good. You strike first.” Han Sen stood atop the sea, unmoving.
“Sure, I’ll strike first,” Nine-Headed Bird said, but he continued looking at Han Sen without attacking.
Nine-Headed Bird was certain that he could defeat Han Sen as long as the Kingese were not a factor. Making Han Sen move would be easy.
But Han Sen was a prince of the Extreme King, so Nine-Headed Bird knew better than to attack carelessly. He considered the best way to move Han Sen from his spot.
“What? You still haven’t attacked. Is a half-deified being terrified of me?” Han Sen laughed.
Nine-Headed Bird lifted his lips in a sneer. “Didn’t I tell you? Trying to provoke me won’t work.”
After that, Nine-Headed Bird looked at Han Sen and thought to himself, “His Original Water King Body cannot be destroyed. Even if I completely wreck his upper body, his legs might remain untouched. No matter how powerful my hit is, it’s not guaranteed that I can move his feet.”
Thinking of that, Nine-Headed Bird had an idea. He prepared to strike.
“Hang on.” Han Sen suddenly raised his hand to stop the man.
“What? Are you regretting our agreement?” Nine-Headed Bird stared at Han Sen.






Han Sen laughed. “I have nothing to regret, but before you strike, we should discuss our deal.”
“What game are you trying to play now? We already established the terms of our bargain; you give me the Ancient God Origin if you lose. It’s that simple.” Nine-Headed Bird frowned.
“I will relinquish the Ancient God Origin if I lose, but what if you lose? If we don’t sort out that aspect of the bargain, you might keep trying to take my Ancient God Origin after you lose. I have no protection here,” Han Sen said.
“If I lose, I won’t try to take the Ancient God Origin again. Even if you threw it on the ground before me, I wouldn’t dare to pick it up,” Nine-Headed Bird said.
“Awesome. Come on, then.” Han Sen activated his Original Water King Body, and his entire body became translucent. He stood atop the sea as if he was connected to it.
“So you were planning to use the Original Water King Body to win. That was a poor choice.” Nine-Headed Bird coldly hummed. He raised his hand, and a black demonic air gathered in front of his fist. It formed a ceaselessly swirling black hole.
Bzzt!
Nine-Headed Bird punched toward Han Sen, and space itself trembled around his fist. The black hole moved directly toward Han Sen, and its frightening power tugged on everything around it.
Han Sen was still some distance from the black hole, but it was already pulling at him. His water body shook, as if the water of his form could break away and be sucked into the black hole at any time.
Nine-Headed Bird’s attack didn’t strike Han Sen’s body directly. Rather than being intended as a destructive attack, it was meant to affect Han Sen’s balance. Its magnetic force would keep pulling until Han Sen’s body was sucked inside.
Because Nine-Headed Bird had greater power, Han Sen’s body would be drawn in by the black hole. There was no way he could lose.
Han Sen barely seemed to notice the black hole, though. He remained motionless atop the water. He was not moving into the black hole.
Nine-Headed Bird frowned. His attack was better than any Han Sen could unleash without using his Kingese power. He should have been falling into the black hole.
But Han Sen wasn’t moving. He wasn’t using the Kingese or some sort of xenogeneic treasure, either. Nine-Headed Bird stared at Han Sen in confusion.
Han Sen laughed. He had suggested this bet because he knew he would win. He wouldn’t take this risk on a whim.
Nine-Headed Bird couldn’t see anything strange about Han Sen’s stance, but Han Sen still could have used some sort of trick without his knowledge.
Han Sen had suggested this bet because he had the Silver-Winged Dragon beast soul.
King class xenogeneic beast soul Silver-Winged Dragon: area type
Han Sen didn’t know if only King class beast souls had an area-of-effect, but at that moment, it was the only area beast soul that he had.
The Silver-Winged Dragon could deploy a water area, but it was different from Bai Yi’s natural water area. This water area was called the dragon area. The sea dragon had the soul of the sea, so if Han Sen used the dragon area in the water, he could become a part of the sea. His body melded with the sea itself.
Han Sen stood atop the sea, using the power of the sea to keep him erect. Although he couldn’t control it with accuracy, he couldn’t be moved unless Nine-Headed Bird summoned enough power to shift the entire sea.
A bar of iron might be easily moved, but if it was welded onto an aircraft carrier, no amount of pulling could force it to budge.
Of course, a stick couldn’t control an aircraft carrier. But merely remaining stable was enough for Han Sen.
With the dragon area, standing atop the sea made Han Sen effectively immortal. Nine-Headed Bird could do nothing to him.
Nine-Headed Bird kept increasing the strength of his black hole, but he was unable to move Han Sen. His eyes began to widen.
Xius watched the contest, frozen in place. She had no idea how Han Sen was pulling this off.

“Nine-Headed Bird, can you keep going?” Han Sen smiled.
Nine-Headed Bird grunted coldly. He dismissed his black hole, then lowered his arms. He spoke to Han Sen, “Come. If you can move me, then I lose. If I do not move, then I will attack again. We will decide the victor then.”
“Then I will start,” Han Sen said, summoning his wings. He flapped his wings and flew far away.
Nine-Headed Bird’s eyes bulged. Han Sen was about to disappear from his vision. He was so mad that he turned into the nine-headed demon bird again. He ran after Han Sen and angrily shouted, “Disgusting Extreme King! Are you going to embarrass your father like that? You lose!”
Han Sen stopped. He turned around and looked at Nine-Headed Bird with a grin.
“What is this bullsh*t?” Nine-Headed Bird slid to a stop. His face turned a sickly green as he realized he had just been tricked.
He had lost because he chased after Han Sen. He had fallen for the simplest of ploys.

Chapter 2356 Back to the Extreme King
Han Sen had obviously planned this.
Because Han Sen let Nine-Headed Bird strike first, Nine-Headed Bird had a chance of winning. That was why Nine-Headed Bird agreed to the bet. But Han Sen’s dragon area defeated Nine-Headed Bird’s first attack, and the moment he stopped attacking was the moment he sealed his loss.
“Can I go now?” Han Sen smiled at Nine-Headed Bird.
“Get lost! Do not let me see you ever again.” Nine-Headed Bird’s face was contorted with anger. Without waiting for Han Sen to respond, he turned and flew away.
Han Sen was surprised. He hadn’t expected Nine-Headed Bird to keep his promise, but it was a good thing he had.
The dragon area’s power came from its connection to water; if Han Sen was sealed inside the Suppress Demon Coffin, he would lose his connection with the sea and get pulled into the demonic abyss.
Unless Han Sen used his super god spirit body, he wouldn’t have been able to defeat Nine-Headed Bird.
Without any hesitation, Han Sen flew up into the air and headed back to Half-Star Bay. He didn’t say another word to Xius.
If Miss Mirror hadn’t left yet, that was where she would be. Too many elites wanted to get their hands on the Ancient God Origin. Staying next to Miss Mirror would be the safest thing for Han Sen, as it would prevent others from trying to take the item away from him.
Although Han Sen could probably escape, Bao’er was still with the Extreme King. So, Han Sen felt obliged to remain.
He flew for a few hundred meters, but suddenly, he felt the crackle of lightning all around him. A giant that looked like either a demon or a god hung there in the clouds. A hand came slapping down towards Han Sen.
The hand slowed down, and the air around Han Sen concentrated until it was as dense as a steel board. Han Sen couldn’t tear through the air. He couldn’t move his body.
“A deified elite!” Han Sen felt a chill, and he prepared to fight back. Just as he was about to lash out, a sword-light appeared and slashed across the big hand.
“Argh!” The giant in the clouds screamed and pulled his hand back. The god-like eyes looked down to where he had been struck. A beautiful woman holding a copper sword in her hands had emerged.








“Miss Mirror!” Han Sen was so happy.
That giant stared at Miss Mirror, then disappeared. He seemed to be afraid of Miss Mirror, and he obviously didn’t want to make an enemy out of her.
“I cannot believe Ancient Water God selected you.” Miss Mirror came before Han Sen and looked at the Ancient God Origin he was holding.
“Isn’t that why you brought me here?” Han Sen said.
“I was just here to try my luck. I didn’t place any hope in you, so I didn’t expect you would succeed,” Miss Mirror said simply.
Han Sen touched his nose and looked at the blood-red sea.
Miss Mirror seemed to know what Han Sen was thinking. In a neutral tone of voice, she said, “Extreme King ships are here. They will take over the planets that were touched by Ancient Water God’s blood.”
Miss Mirror hadn’t come for the Ancient God Origin at all; she just wanted to claim the system that had been flooded with Ancient Water God’s blood.
After Ancient Water God’s failure and the subsequent dispersal of his blood, the primitive creatures of these planets would now grow strong. Even barren planets would now flourish because of Ancient Water God’s lifeblood.
The watery area that came from Ancient Water God’s blood had an incredible lifeforce. It could grow many scary xenogeneics. This was exactly what the Extreme King needed.
On the flipside, the Ancient God Origin wasn’t as important. It could only be used to grow one strong water element elite. It was nothing compared to the value of an entire system.
Han Sen followed Miss Mirror back to the ship, and he saw that the Extreme King’s ships were splitting up to guard the individual planets of the system.
Han Sen found the blood kirin was on their ship, and he was surprised that it had sat and waited for him the entire time. It obviously wasn’t the mindless beast Han Sen had believed it to be.
When the blood kirin saw Miss Mirror, it looked hostile and scared.
Han Sen could guess why. Ancient Water God had moved Han Sen far away, and the blood kirin wouldn’t listen to Miss Mirror’s commands. She must have used some sort of trick to get the creature onboard a ship.
“This woman is too tricky. I don’t know what she wants. Why didn’t she tell anyone else that I’m not actually Bai Yi?” Han Sen stroked the ring on his finger and thought to himself, “It most likely has something to do with this ring. But she didn’t force me to take the ring off. Why?”
Han Sen didn’t understand. He knew he would have to stop thinking about it. He brought out the xenogeneic gene of the Silver-Winged Dragon and swallowed it to refine it.
Duke Gene +1... Duke Gene +1...
The Duke gene announcements kept sounding-off in Han Sen’s head. He received ten Duke genes in total.
“If I can get a few more King class xenogeneic genes, then I won’t have to worry about The Story of Genes.” Han Sen was both happy and worried.
Miss Mirror didn’t remain on the planet for long. She had been needed during the takeover, but she wasn’t in charge of building up the planet. Her task was finished before most of the Extreme King’s ships even arrived.
Han Sen knew Miss Mirror had many elites around her, but they didn’t appear in her proximity.
Taking such an important system would be a bloody affair.
The Ancient God wouldn’t give up the place easily, so both sides would make sacrifices in the attempt to claim the system. The price would be high whether they succeeded or failed.
After going back to King’s Kingdom, Han Sen took the blood kirin with him back to Planet Water Zone. Miss Mirror didn’t detain him, and she said nothing more to him. No one else sought to trouble him, either.
That made Han Sen even more worried, though. He didn’t know what was going through Miss Mirror’s head, and he had no idea what her ultimate goal was.

“I can just put Bao’er back in the sanctuaries. That will be safer for both of us,” Han Sen thought in irritation. He would need to take Bao’er back from Lan Haixin.
Before Han Sen could find Lan Haixin, though, she came looking for him. She looked fairly moody, too.
“Bai Yi, did you forget something?” Lan Haixin found Han Sen in the garden and looked at him with a raised eyebrow. She didn’t say what she wanted explicitly because she was still suspicious about Han Sen’s identity.
“Last month, on the ninth. I remember. But Miss Mirror took me somewhere to do something. I had no choice,” Han Sen said with a shrug. He then thought to himself, “It is fortunate I have Bao’er as a spy.”
“It is good that you remember. But since we missed it, we must now wait another two months. You better behave over the course of the next two months and stop giving me trouble.” After Lan Haixin spoke, she left. She didn’t even spare him a second glance.

Chapter 2357 Killing Underwater Xenogeneics
Because Han Sen was uncertain of Miss Mirror’s ultimate goal, he didn’t dare take any obvious risks. He remained on Planet Water Zone and spent his time hunting down Duke xenogeneics. He wanted to fill up his Duke genes.
Han Sen found a few Duke xenogeneics, killed them, and consumed their Duke genes. Their xenogeneic genes increased his Duke gene tally by one point each, so leveling up was a very slow process. It wasn’t as fast as eating one King xenogeneic gene to claim ten Duke gene points.
He didn’t want to cause much of a ruckus. He needed to be patient and slowly trawl through Planet Water Zone in the hunt for Duke xenogeneics.
“What is this?” Han Sen came across a little mountain moving across the bottom of the sea. It slid forward at a very slow pace, but Han Sen could tell that it really was moving.
When Han Sen rode the blood kirin down to get a better look, he realized that it wasn’t actually a mountain. It was a conch. The shell was one hundred meters tall. It was black and greyish, and it looked like stone from a distance.
Beneath the conch, the white skirt of the conch was revealed. It was slowly flapping and moving across the sand.
Feeling Han Sen and the blood kirin draw near, the mountainous conch moved its flesh and released a blue light. It covered an area of one thousand meters, cloaking Han Sen and the blood kirin at the same time.
The blood kirin was angered. His blood air exploded out from him as he thundered toward the sea conch.
Han Sen didn’t know what the sea conch’s area did. It didn’t seem to affect Han Sen directly. The blood kirin soon came before the sea conch, though, with that blood air swirling all around him.
The sea conch retreated back into its shell as the blood kirin’s claws skittered across the hard surface of the shell, leaving some scratch marks across it.
The blood kirin roared in fury. It kept swinging its claws at the conch, trying to break through the shell. But despite its strength, the blood kirin couldn’t leave behind anything more than light scratches. The conch shell was one hundred meters tall, so those scratches were inconsequential.
“A King class xenogeneic?” Han Sen was delighted by this discovery. If its shell was that sturdy, the creature must have been King class. A weak King class, judging by its fleshy body, but a King class nonetheless.
The blood kirin continued striking the shell, but each blow left less and less of a mark. It was rather confusing to Han Sen.
Han Sen pulled out his Ghost Teeth Knife and swiped across the shell. It did nothing, and his performance paled in comparison to the blood kirin’s.














Han Sen frowned. He pulled out his Thunder God Spike, summoned its lightning, then thrust it toward the sea conch’s shell. He wanted to paralyze the beast. After that, he could flip it on its back and slay it from below.
But the creature’s shell seemed to insulate it perfectly from the lightning of the Thunder God Spike. That made Han Sen raise an eyebrow. “This guy’s shell is really hard. But it is so big. I bet it would make an amazing armor.”
The shell was far too large to be used for a single set of armor. Still, it would make an excellent construction material for something larger.
Before Han Sen could make something out of it, though, he first had to kill it. He tried all sorts of different powers, but his strongest attack could only deliver a mark that was a few inches across. It had no effect on the sea conch.
“Let’s flip it!” Han Sen called to the blood kirin. Gathering their strength, they turned the sea conch over. After flipping it, though, they realized it was sealed on the bottom. There was no way in. The opening was blocked by the same material that composed the rest of the shell.
As they looked over the creature again, Han Sen and the blood kirin realized that the marks they had left on its shell had vanished. Their efforts had been wasted.
“This isn’t right. This guy probably has a third-tier area. How else could the conch shell be so hard? Even the blood kirin, with an attack at full power, only leaves a small mark...” Han Sen looked around at the blue lights of the area that was all around. “How does this conch have such a powerful king area?”
They had been there for a long time, but the blue light hadn’t done any damage to Han Sen or the blood kirin. It certainly wasn’t meant as an attack.
“Is this a weakening area, perhaps?” Han Sen considered the possibility, but it didn’t seem quite right.
If it was a weakening area, he should have been able to feel his own power losing strength. Han Sen wasn’t sensing any energy drain, though; his body was full of vigor.
“If it isn’t a weakening type, then could it be a cell-strengthening type? Does the blue light increase the shell’s strength?” Han Sen stroked his jaw as he thought about this, but he ultimately discarded this idea as well.
If it was a cell-strengthening area, the sea conch wouldn’t have needed to release the light into such a large area. The wider the area, the more spread out the power would be. The cell-strengthening area would only be required around the shell itself. Why would the creature need to extend its reach so far?
“If it isn’t a weakening or a cell-strengthening area, what is it?” Han Sen stared at the sea conch as he mulled over the conundrum.
The blood kirin had a short temper, and its inability to damage the sea conch’s shell was making the blood kirin more and more furious. It kept trying to bite the shell, but nothing worked. The marks they left were becoming lighter and lighter.
“Hang on... The blood kirin’s power hasn’t weakened. In fact, his anger has made him even stronger. Why are his scratch marks becoming lighter?” Han Sen stared at the scratch marks on the conch shell. After a while, his eyes sparkled. “Is his area power...”
Han Sen swam next to the conch shell and stroked the scratch marks across its surface. The blood kirin stopped attacking.
Not long after, the scratch marks were gone. The healing unfolded before their eyes.
If even a top-class half-deified creature like the blood kirin couldn’t break the conch’s shell, then the shell was unbelievably hard.
Han Sen didn’t think that the strength was coming from the material of the shell, though. The conch shell was very hard, but its incredible resistance was because of the creature’s King area.
Han Sen didn’t know if his guess was correct, so after a moment of thought, he took the blood kirin and left. They departed the sea conch’s area of blue light.
The sea conch behaved as if it knew what they were doing. It spread the blue light further, but the max range was two thousand meters. It couldn’t extend the light beyond that.
When Han Sen and the blood kirin got far enough away that the sea conch couldn’t feel their presence, they hid behind a big rock, Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to observe the sea conch in the distance.
The sea conch waited there for a while. It must have been almost half an hour before the creature emerged from the shell to look around. After a while, when it didn’t see Han Sen and the blood kirin in the vicinity, it shut off its blue light.
Upon seeing that, Han Sen summoned Spell. He turned her into a sniper rifle and took aim at the sea conch.
Pang!
Without hesitation, Han Sen squeezed the trigger. The bullet fired out of the barrel and broke through the water. It was silently headed for the sea conch.

Chapter 2358 Weird Area
Normal bullets would face too much resistance when fired underwater. The shot would become weaker the farther it had to travel, and the sea conch would likely notice its approach.
But Han Sen had his Original Water King Body and sea dragon area. He combined with the sea of Planet Water Zone itself. He used his water powers to create Spell’s ammunition, so the bullet also had water abilities. Rather than being slowed down by the water it passed through, the bullet was actually buffed by the sea. It flew toward the sea conch silently, like a phantom.
But Han Sen wasn’t firing at the exposed flesh of the creature. He was firing at the conch’s shell.
Pang!
The bullet hit the sea conch’s shell, punching a small hole straight through. The sea conch shook and immediately activated its blue light. The light quickly covered the sea conch’s shell, protecting the small hole.
“So that’s how it works.” Han Sen was happier. He looked at the bullet hole and noticed that some white juice was flowing out of it. Although the wound was very small, it proved that his bullets could pierce through the shell and damage the creature’s body.
Now Han Sen knew for certain that the light made the conch’s shell so hard, not the material of the conch shell itself.
Han Sen’s shot was far weaker than the blood kirin’s attacks, too. But still, his bullets were able to penetrate the conch’s shell. The blood kirin’s claws were only able to leave light scratch marks upon it. It was obvious by now that the difference was because of the blue light area.
Han Sen stayed where he was and lifted his sniper rifle to aim at the sea conch again. He fired a few times, all of his bullets flying true and striking the shell.
None of those bullets were able to break the conch’s shell, though. Under the glow of the blue light, they left small marks on the surface of the shell.
“When the bullets go through the blue area, they don’t lose speed or power. But when they strike the conch’s shell, they don’t have the impact that they should.” Han Sen looked at the sea conch with interest.
After a while, the bullet hole Han Sen had made filled in and disappeared completely. The conch’s recovery power was very strong.
“No wonder Bai Yi left behind a King xenogeneic. He probably couldn’t figure out how to kill it; he didn’t leave it alive because he wanted to.” Han Sen laughed.
Since Bai Yi had been unable to kill it, this was a good opportunity for Han Sen. He and the blood kirin remained in hiding, and he was determined to kill the King class xenogeneic.








He only had guesses about how to bring the creature down, though. He didn’t have a surefire way of breaking the blue light area, so he planned to wait there until the sea conch relaxed.
The sea conch had learned from Han Sen’s previous attack, and it didn’t reveal itself so quickly this time. It took a few hours before the sea conch was willing to reveal its flesh once more.
This time, however, it didn’t deactivate its blue light. It continued using the blue area as it traveled into the deeper recesses of the sea.
Han Sen thought the thing would be heavy and slow, but it ran away like a rabbit. Han Sen watched the small mountain flee into the deep sea, creating eddies and vortexes as it went.
Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to keep an eye on the thing as he pursued it, waiting for the moment the creature decided to relax.
Now that the sea conch had been damaged, it was being careful. It was moving fast, and it carefully maintained its King area the entire time.
Han Sen wasn’t in a rush, though. He just continued to follow it. The creature was too big to hide from him easily.
Plus, Han Sen had two water areas. Escaping from him in the water would be practically impossible. Han Sen was very confident in his water-aligned powers.
But Han Sen noticed that his current confidence had come a little too soon. When the sea conch passed by another underwater mountain, it disappeared.
After it climbed behind the mountain, it didn’t re-emerge. Han Sen thought it might have come back to its home, but when he looked around the mountain, he couldn’t find the sea conch anywhere.
“Weird. Where did it go?” Han Sen looked around, but he saw no sign of the creature.
The gap between the mountains was small, so there was nowhere else for it to go. The sea conch was too big for Han Sen to have missed it if it came out. That was why Han Sen waited near the mountain.
But there was nothing to see. The sea conch had truly vanished.
“You think you can escape my sight that simply? You are too naive.” Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly and his Dongxuan Aura to scan for the sea conch’s molecular trail. He found it and began following.
Han Sen quickly realized that there was a small hole in the ground near the mountain. The hole was the size of a man’s fist. The sea conch’s trail disappeared into it. The conch had tricked him.
“That sea conch can change its size? Why didn’t it display that power earlier?” Han Sen wondered.
“Blood kirin, go in and take a look at what it’s doing. But don’t alert it to your presence.” Han Sen wasn’t very good at changing the size of his body, but the blood kirin was a professional. It could change its size effortlessly.
The blood kirin roared. Its body shook as its bones shrank. It became one size smaller, and then it continued to reduce until the red beast looked like a little toy. Then, it climbed into the hole.
Han Sen waited on the outside. He looked around and examined the trench that led to the hole.
Han Sen had studied the Xuanmen techniques left behind by Mister White. He learned a few of the skills, but they were very simple. He only mastered a couple of their methods of calculation, but if a situation was quite simple, he could use those techniques to provide some insight.
The underwater mountain was very special. There were many mountains nearby, and they were all connected together. The mountains were shaped like volcanoes with craters at the top, and there were large holes in the peaks.
From above, the nine mountains looked like a chain of interlocking rings. Han Sen remembered in the Xuanmen technique that this kind of environment was called the Nine Rings.
If that sort of landscape was in the Alliance, no one would have dared to live there. Such a place had a lot of bad luck, and people who chose to live there would suffer the consequences.
But that theory might not have applied to the geno universe. Mister White said the Xuanmen techniques required many improvements for the geno universe. Techniques and powers were different in the sanctuary and the geno universe, and he was interested in researching those differences.
Han Sen was checking out the mountain when a white shadow suddenly appeared from the peaks. It was a big electric eel that was a dozen meters long. As it swam, its white scales sparked with electricity. It looked weirdly pretty.
“Another King class xenogeneic!” Han Sen frowned. This was unexpected.

Chapter 2359 Hunting King Class Xenogeneics
As far as Han Sen knew, Bai Yi cleared Planet Water Zone a long time ago. Even Lan Haixin hadn’t bothered sending out hunting parties. But now, Han Sen had met two King class xenogeneics in a row. Both were in the same vicinity, too. This posed a big problem.
Pulling out his Thunder God Spike, Han Sen went towards the King class electric eel.
Han Sen didn’t really care what change Planet Water Zone was experiencing right now. He was just going to kill any King class creatures he found. Getting King class genes was good for him.
He used his Original Water King Body, then unleashed his dragon area as well. Han Sen moved like a water dragon as he rushed toward the big electric eel. The Thunder God Spike flickered with scary silver lightning, and the sound of thunder rumbled along its path.
Han Sen’s King areas entangled the giant electric eel. The water restricted the eel’s body, and the creature swam extremely slowly, as if it was moving through mud.
While Han Sen rejoiced at the success of his attack, the electric eel suddenly loosed a crackling discharge of lightning. The lightning created a scary thunder area and merged with Han Sen’s own area. The electricity shot through the water and into Han Sen. His hair instantly poofed straight out and began vibrating with the force of the current.
Pang!
Han Sen’s electrified body bounced away. He came to a stop after arcing through the water for a long time. His tongue felt numb.
“A king area focused purely on attack is too scary. And that electricity has a strong paralytic effect. This is at least a sixth-tier area. This electric eel will be hard to deal with.” Han Sen held still in an attempt to hide himself, but the electric eel was already rushing toward him. Its thunder area came with it, and streams of electric chains shot out of its mouth.
Han Sen used his water skills to dodge the thunder area and the lightning chains. Fortunately, he still had the benefits of his water areas. He moved much faster in the water than the electric eel did. If not for his speed advantage, he would have already taken more hits. That would have been extremely painful—even if his body could withstand it.
After dodging out of the eel’s immediate attack range, Han Sen summoned Spell’s dual pistols and started firing. It wasn’t the sea conch, so Han Sen didn’t have to worry too much about its blocking abilities.
When the bullets entered the thunder area, the eel reacted immediately. It spewed more of that lightning to destroy the incoming bullets.
But one or two of the bullets still managed to strike the eel’s scales. Familiar symbols began to shine across the impacted scales, showing the results of Han Sen’s Turtle skill.
The Turtle skill took effect, and after a few more shots landed, the electric eel was much slower. However, the lightning on its body was still incredibly strong, and the creature’s thunder area covered the surrounding region, so Han Sen couldn’t get close to the creature.








Pang!
Spell became a sniper rifle, and Han Sen fired a bullet toward the electric eel. The bullet shattered the eel’s scales and tore into its side. Purple Teeth power spread across the wound.
Han Sen’s techniques weren’t King class yet, and his Original Water King Body only had a first-tier area. Taking down a King class xenogeneic with a sixth-tier area would be incredibly difficult.
Luckily, the Turtle skill worked well against the eel. Because of that, the foe was unable to catch up to Han Sen. He led it to the seabed, firing continually at the creature. Teeth power continued to shred its wounds. As it lost more and more blood, the electric eel’s area grew weaker.
“Xenogeneic King hunted: Electric Dragon. Xenogeneic gene found.”
Han Sen watched the giant electric eel’s body sink while the announcement played in his head.
“It is a shame I didn’t receive its beast soul. An electric beast soul would have been very powerful.” Han Sen swam over to the electric eel’s body and dug out its xenogeneic gene.
He summoned his Shadow Queen Bee and let it eat the big electric eel’s body.
Shadow Queen Bee hadn’t matured yet, and Han Sen was already a Duke. The Queen Bee wouldn’t be useful to him at this point, but since he had the meat available, he might as well let her eat it. Otherwise, it would all be wasted.
Shadow Queen Bee crawled over the body and ate with difficulty. Han Sen swallowed the entire electrified bone that was the xenogeneic gene. He also used his Consume talent to refine it with haste.
A numb feeling swept over Han Sen’s body. It was like his cells were electrified, and they began to vibrate with energy.
“Duke gene... Duke gene...”
When Han Sen finished refining the electric bone, his Duke gene tally had reached eighty-four. He was close to having a hundred.
“If I kill two more King class xenogeneics, I’ll have maxed it out. And then, I can open The Story of Genes’ first gene lock.” As Han Sen was calculating, he heard a boom in the distance.
Something tore its way out of the little hole under the mountain, dramatically widening the opening. The blood kirin emerged from the swirls of debris and returned to its ordinary size.
Blood dripped from the blood kirin’s mouth, and grievous injuries marred its scales. It was in very bad condition.
Patong!
The blood kirin made it back to Han Sen, then fell onto its stomach on the seafloor. It struggled to get up.
Wounds covered its legs, and one leg had been twisted ninety-degrees. Black blood oozed around the wound.
The black blood drifted into the water around the blood kirin’s body, then turned into some sort of small black bugs. They latched on to the blood kirin and started nibbling on its wounds and scales.
The blood kirin was a cruel and violent beast, but now it was actually squealing.
Han Sen was shocked. The blood kirin was a half-deified xenogeneic that was nearly peerless, and judging from the way it had been injured, it had encountered something other than the sea conch.
The blood kirin’s blood continued to become bugs, and Han Sen couldn’t determine what sort of power had been used against his companion.
Han Sen was still holding the Thunder God Spike, and he poked it into the blood kirin’s wound. The black bugs began to shriek as Han Sen electrified them, and after a minute, they all fell off the wound.
Those bugs vanished, but the blood gushing from the blood kirin’s wounds was turning into more black bugs. If that continued, the blood kirin’s veins were going to run dry.
Han Sen looked at the little bugs, and he realized they were actually small sea conches.

Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to see what was going on with the blood kirin. Many small, black sea conches were squirming around inside the blood kirin. There were too many to count, and the sight of them made Han Sen feel sick. At the rate that the blood kirin’s body was being devoured, it wouldn’t be long until only its bones remained.
Han Sen wondered how he might save the blood kirin, but then something else came crawling out of the hole that the blood kirin had expanded. The newcomer’s body swelled back to normal size. It was that same, King class sea conch.
Before Han Sen could react, another sea conch emerged from the hole. This one was beautiful and full of color. Its shell was like a crystal, and its colors shifted and glowed like a rainbow.
When Han Sen saw that beautiful sea conch, the color drained out of his face.


Chapter 2360 Rainbow Crystal Sea Conch
Han Sen knew with a single glance that he was looking at a deified creature. It was nothing like the black, mountainous sea conch.
Han Sen grabbed the blood kirin and turned to run, but it was too late. A rainbow-like aura covered the sea around him.
Han Sen felt like his body was stuck to the ground, and he was unable to move. Many rainbow-colored substance chains were rising through the water to bind him.
“D*mn it! Why is there a deified creature here? This is bad.” Han Sen activated his super god spirit body without hesitation.
His body immediately became transparent. He shone so brightly that the colorful substance chains heading toward Han Sen suddenly lost their target.
Rather than attempting to fight back, Han Sen’s first reaction was to lift the blood kirin and run away as fast as he could. Even the weakest deified would be more than a match for Han Sen.
The rainbow crystal sea conch wasn’t as powerful as Ancient Water God, but it still wasn’t something Han Sen could fight against.
If Han Sen became King class, perhaps there was a chance he could fight off a deified. But right now, Han Sen was just a Duke. He needed some outside help just to fight a half-deified being; fighting a deified would be suicide.
A half-deified was like an incredibly powerful King, but deifieds were on a different level entirely.
The rainbow crystal sea conch saw Han Sen traveling freely through its substance chains, and it rocked back in apparent shock. Its crystal body flashed, and the substance chains turned into rainbow-colored glass. The glass surged up around Han Sen.
Han Sen poured all of his power into his super god spirit body, running his technique as hard as he could. The weird power was injected into the blood kirin, and the blood kirin’s body became similarly transparent. Under the force of Han Sen’s will, the blood kirin’s body also adopted the qualities of super god spirit mode.
Han Sen lifted the blood kirin higher and hit the rainbow glass. They shot through it like ghosts, the glass wisping around them as if it wasn’t even there. The rainbow glass was unable to stop Han Sen and his super god spirit body.
But the super god spirit body had a time limit. Han Sen was carrying the blood kirin as he fled, and that cost him even more energy. After they escaped the rainbow glass, Han Sen ran back in the direction he had come.
The rainbow crystal sea conch managed to catch up. Countless substance chains rose from the ground and continued their attempts to capture Han Sen. He brushed right through them at first, but after a while, he was unable to sustain the power requirements of the super god spirit body. Every time he passed through the rainbow glass, it cost him a lot of energy.








When Han Sen hit the next pane of rainbow glass, he felt as if he had thrust himself into sticky liquid. It was difficult to wiggle his way through.
Han Sen knew that this was the sign that he was losing his super god spirit body. If this continued, his super god spirit body would entirely fail. He would be unable to break the substance chain glass with his power.
“What do I do? Do I have to jump into the sanctuary? If I go back to the sanctuary, the blood kirin will die...” Han Sen thought rapidly, but he couldn’t come up with a solution to his predicament.
The deified xenogeneic’s speed would make escape virtually impossible. Han Sen used all of his strength, but it was useless before that absolute power and speed.
Super god spirit body’s ability to make him invincible was the sole reason he hadn’t been trapped.
Han Sen’s heart was burning. He knew he could escape to the sanctuaries, but his greatest worry lay in the blood kirin. Han Sen carried the blood kirin’s bleeding body, and luckily, his super god spirit mode had lent some of its strength to the blood kirin. Han Sen’s power killed the small, black sea conches and made the blood kirin feel better.
But now, the two large sea conches were still a serious problem. One was a King with a powerful King area, and the other was a genuine deified xenogeneic. Even if he used his super god spirit body to attack them, he wouldn’t be able to save the blood kirin.
In Underwater Town, Bao’er was eating lunch with Lan Haixin. Halfway through her dessert, Bao’er’s face paled. She suddenly leaped off her chair.
“Bao’er, what is it?” Lan Haixin looked at Bao’er with confusion.
“Stomach ache. I have to go to the bathroom,” Bao’er said, then left the room with the little red bird in tow.
“This kid...” Lan Haixin shook her head and smiled. She looked so happy. She had really come to love Bao’er, and she even kept Bao’er in her room with her at night. They were like real sisters.
Bao’er ran to the garden and bit her finger. She let a droplet of blood fall on the little red bird’s forehead, and she said, “Little red bird, my stupid father is in trouble. My blood will guide you to him. Go and save him.”
After that, Bao’er threw the little red bird upward. The little red bird flapped its wings and became a red light. Then, it disappeared from the town.
Han Sen was still holding on, but his super god spirit body was flickering. It was almost gone, and it could disappear completely at any second.
Han Sen’s body struck the rainbow glass again, and now, it was as if he was striking leather. Han Sen gritted his teeth and pushed forward, but he was squashed out.
The super god spirit body couldn’t hold on any longer. Han Sen fell out of that mode and returned to being a human composed of ordinary flesh again.
Han Sen tried to use the super god spirit body’s remaining power to attack the sea conch, but it wasn’t that useful.
The super god spirit body buffed Han Sen quite a bit. It could ignore the defenses of creatures and attack things directly. Even so, attacking a beast that was two levels above him was pointless.
Pang!
Another pane of rainbow glass fell. It was going to cover Han Sen and the blood kirin, and so Han Sen tried punching it. His fist was lit by Kingese, but he was unable to fracture the rainbow glass.
Han Sen kept punching the glass, and the sounds of the blows echoed over the seafloor. Han Sen’s bones were about to break and his fists were bleeding, but he couldn’t break the rainbow glass.
The power of Super Spank struck the substance chains of the rainbow glass, but even that was bounced back. Super Spank could find a single link of the chain that was weak enough to break.
The blood kirin fell on the ground, looking to be in a really dire condition. It was still able to release horrid screams as it tried to struggle back to its feet and fight against the rainbow glass alongside Han Sen. But after a few tries, it collapsed again with blood spewing from its mouth.
The black stone sea conch moved alongside the rainbow crystal sea conch. They were moving slowly. Two sea conches climbed atop the rainbow glass, looking at Han Sen and the blood kirin through its transparent surface.
The black sea conch’s eyes looked very human. They glared at Han Sen with disdain.
The rainbow crystal sea conch looked at Han Sen with its dreamy eyes. And then, the rainbow glass surrounding Han Sen began to shrink. It was squeezing Han Sen and the blood kirin together.
