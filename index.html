  <h1>My Test</h1>

  
  
  <p> “Why?” Han Sen’s lip curled a little.
“If you want the relic, then give her to me. Otherwise, don’t even think about it. The choice is yours.” The princess’ face didn’t change.
“Fine. Whatever. She is just a useless kid. If you want her, then you can have her.” Han Sen rolled his eyes and returned to the building. He brought out Bao’er and lobbed her toward the princess.
The princess frowned. She caught Bao’er and immediately turned away from Han Sen. She took Bao’er away from the garden. She moved hurriedly, as if remaining in the garden for one more second would make her feel incredibly filthy.
Bao’er lay across the princess’ shoulder, clutching her neck. She winked at Han Sen.
“D*mn woman... Don’t let me find a chance...” Han Sen grumbled, but he winked back at Bao’er.
The princess wanted Bao’er, and Han Sen needed Bao’er to amass information on his behalf. Bao’er’s intelligence and power made her a great infiltrator.
Bai Wei and the princess didn’t give Han Sen any further headaches. He was most worried about the meeting with Bai Ling Shuang, and that was because Han Sen wasn’t sure what sort of deal had been established between Bai Ling Shuang and Bai Yi. He didn’t know what Bai Ling Shuang had offered Bai Yi to make him hunt Han Sen down in Knight’s Paradise.
But Han Sen needed to go to Night Charm Town. Bai Yi would definitely have chosen to go there if he had returned from his confrontation with Han Sen.
Fortunately, Han Sen was able to read all the information that Mister White had given him before the meeting. He knew what sort of social circles Bai Yi traveled in. At the very least, he knew a thing or two about Bai Yi now.
At the proposed time of the meet, Han Sen rode the blood kirin and left Planet Water Zone, heading for Bai Ling Shuang’s Night Charm Town.
Bai Ling Shuang was different from Bai Yi and Bai Wei. She had an abundance of resources. Night Charm Town was like a top club located in King’s Kingdom, but it was only one of Bai Ling Shuang’s many properties.
It was a town, yes, but it was one that covered an entire planet. Because Night Charm Town was very famous among the Extreme King, finding information about the place wasn’t difficult. Han Sen made sure to do his homework before he left. Hopefully, nothing there would be strange to him.
“Go and tell your master that Prince Sixteen Bai Yi is here,” Han Sen said to the receptionist, slapping the woman’s butt and squeezing it firmly. He spoke aloud with much pride.
“My Prince, Night Charm Town doesn’t allow xenogeneics.” The receptionist kept a fixed smile on her face, but her eyes revealed the glint of simmering anger.
“You don’t accept people’s xenogeneics? Well, the xenogeneic of Bai Yi is an exception to your rule,” Han Sen said, then walked forward with the blood kirin.
The faces of the guards changed. They stepped forward as if to stop him, but they then returned to their posts.
There were many noble snobs around there. Compared to Bai Yi, though, those people were pleasant. No one liked Bai Yi, not even the workers.
“Please wait, My Prince. The princess is coming.” The receptionist took Han Sen to a room on the highest floor, then left.
“The Extreme King really know how to enjoy themselves.” Han Sen sat on a sofa and looked around. He stroked the blood kirin’s head as he thought.
“Brother Sixteen, you only have one half-deified xenogeneic. You don’t have to show-off twenty-four-seven.” Bai Ling Shuang walked in and looked at the blood kirin as she spoke.
“Half-deified xenogeneic? This is nothing in your eyes, of course, but to a useless prince such as myself, it is very important. I need to bring it around often.” Han Sen grabbed a glass of wine and drank it. He looked at Bai Ling Shuang. His smile didn’t reach his eyes, and he said, “By the way, thank you for your kindness. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be receiving this.”
Bai Ling Shuang didn’t want to talk to Han Sen more than necessary. She threw something towards him and clapped her hands.
A very attractive woman came in. She stepped up next to Bai Ling Shuang and bowed. Then, she bowed to Han Sen and said, “My name is Cher. It is nice to meet you, My Prince.”
Cher’s body was very attractive, and her eyes could snare a person’s soul. Her voice was like a hook that could draw the attention of all.
“Fox!” Han Sen’s eyes widened as he looked at Cher. He was given a fright. She had fox ears and a fox tail behind her.
“The Extreme King’s Pavilion Pass and Cher are now yours for the day. You should be sufficiently satisfied,” Bai Ling Shuang said emotionlessly.
“You had so much faith in me, Sister Ten.” Han Sen looked at Cher. He pulled her into his arms and reached right into her clothing.
Cher was smiling, but inside, he knew that she hated this.
Bai Ling Shuang coldly grunted and left the room. Han Sen now had a headache. He should have thought more about what Bai Yi would have asked for. As a request from Bai Yi, this sadly made sense.
The Extreme King Pavilion Pass surprised Han Sen, though. He hadn’t been in the Extreme King long, but he had heard about the Extreme King’s Pavilion.
Only the royal children that were rewarded by King Bai were granted a pass. This was an item that allowed one to get into the Extreme King’s Pavilion. One pass could provide one entry.
The legends said that there were many legendary treasures there, and that only the royal children were ever allowed access to them. If one was not a royal child, it would be pointless to have the pass.
Bai Yi had never received a pass before. Han Sen hadn’t expected that the deal with Bai Ling Shuang would earn him an Extreme King’s Pavilion Pass. The unexpected revelation made Han Sen very happy.
In the Extreme King’s Pavilion, randomly selected treasures could be bought for high prices. This was a surprise to Han Sen.
But the other part of Bai Yi’s deal, his desire for a woman—and a Fox woman at that—left Han Sen unsure of how to proceed.
With Bai Yi’s personality, he would have undoubtedly gone crazy all over the Fox woman.
But Han Sen wasn’t Bai Yi. He liked pretty girls too, but he didn’t want to do anything with a woman he didn’t know.
And most importantly, the room had a camera. Han Sen didn’t have a fetish for being watched.
But right now, he was disguised as Bai Yi. Leaving a woman that Bai Yi had always dreamed of without doing anything would inspire suspicion from Bai Ling Shuang.
Han Sen even thought Bai Ling Shuang was probably sitting behind a monitor of the camera’s feed, watching his every move.
Han Sen held Cher by the waist, trying to think about how he might deal with the situation.
“My Prince, this is my first time. Please be gentle...” Cher looked down. Her face seemed red, and the skin of her chest was flushed a little pink. She looked very charming. Seeing her would make anyone feel horny.

Cher’s beauty would make anyone’s heart jump, but in Han Sen’s eyes, she was completely unappealing.
Han Sen had seen many beautiful people in the world. There were countless numbers of them, but he was now past the stage in which he took people for their face value. What was inside was better than what was outside.
Cher looked as if she absolutely despised Bai Yi. That attractiveness she displayed was for a specific purpose, and she showed her body to achieve it. Ordinary people might have been drawn to that, but Han Sen thought it was boring.
Cher wasn’t Han Sen’s type. Even if he really liked her, he wouldn’t do anything with a woman so easily.
But right now, if Han Sen didn’t do something, he would raise suspicions about his identity.
The evil, horny Bai Yi wouldn’t think twice about doing something devilish to that pretty woman.
Bai Ling Shuang wouldn’t believe Han Sen’s lie if he showed restraint.
Han Sen picked up Cher by the waist and took her to the bed.
Cher lay against Han Sen’s chest. She looked so shy, and her arms were around Han Sen’s neck.
When Han Sen put Cher down on the bed, her pretty eyes looked into Han Sen’s own at a very close distance. There was only ten centimeters separating the two.
Han Sen’s eyes shifted away to break the gaze. He wanted to use a geno art, but Cher’s eyes looked very weird. They were magnetic, pulling directly on peoples’ hearts. He was going to get lost in her attractive eyes.
Han Sen’s heart skipped a beat. He gave up on casting a geno art, looking genuinely attracted by her. He had seen these eyes before when he was trapped in Ghost Bone Palace; Fox Queen had tried to trick him the same way. He hadn’t expected Cher to have a command of this ability, as well.
It wasn’t hard to tell that she was one of the Fox. They were two of the same race, and that talent could very well have been a defining ability of the Foxes. It wasn’t too strange that Cher knew how to do this, but compared to Fox Queen, Cher was an amateur.
Cher’s power still surprised Han Sen, though. She was King class for sure, and Han Sen hadn’t been able to tell that before this moment.
The Fox had a skill that hid their strength, and it was very effective.
But thinking about how Fox Queen hid herself as a King class guard amidst the Extreme King despite being deified, this wasn’t half as special.
Han Sen was familiar with this geno art, so he knew what the expected reaction should be. Han Sen’s eyes started to look dazed, as if he was frozen. But he sighed.
A while later, Han Sen looked dazed while lying on Cher. He was like a zombie.
“This Cher is using a luring skill to get me to fall under a spell. She is trying to make me think that I’m going to do something with her. Most people wouldn’t realize what was happening. I wonder if this was her idea, or if it was Bai Ling Shuang who ordered her to do this?” Han Sen wondered. He thought it was more likely to be the second option.
Cher looked at Han Sen with revulsion as she pushed him away. She sat up on the bed and tidied her clothes. She looked utterly disgusted.
A hidden door in the room opened, and Bai Ling Shuang walked in.
Cher bowed to her and said, “My Princess, I used Fox Eye to attract him. He won’t know what happened.”
Bai Ling Shuang nodded. “Good job. Take off his clothes and remove everything. I want to get a proper look at him.”
“My Princess, do you think something is wrong with Prince Sixteen?” Cher asked.
“Not quite... I just feel as if something is amiss with him,” Bai Ling Shuang said.
“It looks like my attempts to imitate Bai Yi are failing,” Han Sen thought as he heard Cher approach him. “Why hasn’t blood kirin reacted?”
Bai Ling Shuang and Cher were there. Han Sen was worried they were going to expose him. He didn’t dare to use his Dongxuan Aura to get a look around the room. He thought the blood kirin was just lying there and not moving. His presence seemed normal, as if he was just sleeping.
But Han Sen knew that the blood kirin couldn’t actually be sleeping. Even if it was, Bai Ling Shuang’s entry surely should have woken it. It was just lying there and not moving. Something must have happened.
Cher moved calmly over to Han Sen and removed all of his clothes. Han Sen just had to remain still; otherwise, everything would fall apart.
Cher brought Han Sen’s clothes and items over to Bai Ling Shuang. Bai Ling Shuang looked through the stuff and said, “This Ghost Teeth Knife is Han Sen’s. This silver thunder blade thing is also Han Sen’s. It could actually be a half-deified weapon. This Jade Drum looks different from the ordinary Jade Drums. Maybe it is a mutant Jade Drum. These items must be Han Sen’s. He certainly got lucky.”
“Why does he only carry Han Sen’s items? Could this be a problem?” Cher frowned.
Han Sen’s heart tightened. He had wanted to carry some of Bai Yi’s items, but they had all been eaten by the blue metal wolf. He had nothing, and there was nothing decent in his house. Han Sen only found some accessories to wear, but there were no xenogeneic treasures or King class items.
Bai Ling Shuang coldly said, “Bai Yi is addicted to sex and gambling. His family didn’t lose because he married Lan Haixin. But that Lan Haixin had her own purposes for marrying him. She isn’t really in love with Bai Yi. What she holds onto won’t be given to Bai Yi. Bai Yi should be a prince, but he is little more than a servant. His situation is quite bad. If things weren’t like this, he wouldn’t have been greedy enough to request my Extreme King’s Pavilion Pass.”
“He got lucky that he was chosen to kill Han Sen. That is a lot to be rewarded with. That Han Sen was special, but he was also so dumb. He went for that b*tch Bai Wei. He deserved to die.” Bai Ling Shang looked through everything and tossed the items away. She walked to the secret door and went on to say, “Go and find a woman of the Pig race. We need to make it look legit. Don’t let this *sshole wonder about anything after waking up.”
“F*ck you, lady. Do you have to be this cruel? This is so f*cking cruel!” Han Sen thought. The Pig people had a human body but a pig head. They were so strong, too. They were little more than thralls.
Bai Ling Shuang was going to put a Pig in bed with him. Han Sen wanted to jump up and kill her.
Cher brought Han Sen’s items over to the bed and threw them down. She brought a leg up and kicked Han Sen’s body hard. She hissed angrily, “You dare to touch me? Wait until later.”
After that, Cher turned around to call for the Pig woman. Han Sen thought quickly, and in the end, he could no longer keep this up. The moment Cher turned around, Han Sen jumped up. He grabbed her back and used his hand to cover her mouth as he threw her on the bed.
Jadeskin’s ice power and Original Water King Body’s King area-of-effect combined and flowed into Cher’s body. She was caught completely off guard, and she was frozen on the spot.
But she was King class, and she tried to fight back. Han Sen’s ice power was melting fast due to her resistance.

“Should I kill her or not?” Han Sen thought to himself.
Cher’s power was stronger than Han Sen had expected. His ice powers didn’t work on her very well, and when Han Sen saw that Cher was about to free herself, he knew that her escaping would result in him being exposed.
But killing Cher wouldn’t exactly make him appear less suspicious, either.
This was Night Charm Town. It wasn’t a place where people were murdered for resources like Knight’s Paradise. In this town, people were required to follow the laws established by the Extreme King. Not even a prince could randomly murder someone with proper cause.
Han Sen’s eyes flashed. Cher, who was currently crushed under Han Sen, was overwhelmed with both anger and fear. She had been fully confident that her Fox Eyes would work on Han Sen, so she had been caught completely off guard when he turned the tables on her.
Fortunately, her own powers were rather impressive. She was stronger than Bai Yi, and she had a high resistance to ice. She couldn’t be bound easily.
Seeing that Cher was about to escape the ice, Han Sen leaned over next to her ear and whispered, “Cher, do you remember Fox Queen?”
When Cher heard this, she shivered. Her attempts to struggle away from him suddenly ceased. Soon after, though, she returned to normal, trying to fight her way free as if she hadn’t heard what Han Sen had just asked her.
Han Sen knew which way the wind was blowing, so he let go of Cher and coldly said, “I am very close with Fox Queen; if that claim was untrue, then you know that I would already be a dead man. So, you had better be quiet and talk. If something happens to me, something will happen to Fox Queen, too.”
“Why would I believe you?” Cher broke through the last of the ice that caked her body, but she didn’t jump away after she freed herself.
Han Sen brought his mouth close to Cher and spoke the two words quietly. “Red Sleeve.”
Cher’s jaw went slack. Clearly, she was aware that Red Sleeve was Fox Queen.
Han Sen now felt much safer. He laid down on Cher and said quietly, “I’m sorry to invade your personal space, but I’m sure you can understand my situation. Can you tell me how I might manage to get through this?”
“You are Han Sen?” Cher wasn’t stupid; not many of the Foxes were. She knew what was really going on, but she just found it hard to believe.
Han Sen was a Duke, and Bai Yi’s Return to Origin had failed. Han Sen had ended up killing Prince Bai Yi, then assumed the man’s identity as a disguise. He was so brave it was almost impossible to fathom.
Han Sen knew that he couldn’t hide his knowledge of Fox Queen, but this was the best result he would be able to achieve, given the current circumstances.
They both had dirt on each other. Han Sen thought that a Fox wouldn’t sell him out unless they absolutely had to.
“What do you say?” Han Sen smiled at Cher.
Many different emotions flickered across Cher’s face. After a while, she gritted her teeth and said, “Wait for me on the bed. I am going to call the Pig lady.”
“Don’t even think about it. If I was willing to do that, why would I have exposed myself?” Han Sen crushed Cher to the bed to keep her from moving.
Cher blushed and said, “If I don’t go, Bai Ling Shuang will notice. Do not worry; I will use a geno art to control the Pig lady. Put on your clothes and wait for me, just don’t get off the bed. Only the bed isn’t faced with a camera.”
“Okay, I will take your word on it this one time.” Han Sen rolled over to the other side of the bed, grabbed his clothes, and put on his garments one by one.
Cher glanced at Han Sen and walked out.
While Han Sen was pulling on his clothes, he receded into thought. When Cher came back, she brought someone who was three meters tall and had a waist that was eight feet wide. It was the Pig.
But it seemed as if the Pig lady was under a spell. Her eyes looked dull, and she listened to Cher’s every command. She fell down on the bed, and the bed made a chorus of squeaky noises.
Cher looked at Han Sen and murmured, “In order to make this work, I need you to make some noise.”
Not long after, Cher took the Pig woman away. She came back and lay down next to Han Sen wearing only a bathrobe.
“How did you disguise yourself as Prince Sixteen?” Cher asked as she lay looking at Han Sen.
“That wasn’t difficult. What about you? You are so young, and you’re surrounded by the elite of the Extreme King. Your life must be hard,” Han Sen said with a broad smile.
“Couldn’t you show a little gratitude? I just saved your life. If I hadn’t, you would have had to do it with that Pig...” When she realized what she was saying, Cher blushed and stopped talking.
“Out of all the Foxes that I have met, you are the least shameless. You seem to be very pure, yet you’ve also managed to achieve King class. You must be quite famous among the Foxes,” Han Sen said with a smile.
Cher raised her red lips in a slight sneer. “Are you trying to get information out of a Fox? You are too naive.”
“We are merely making a trade. You think too much.” Han Sen coughed.
Han Sen was very interested in Fox Queen’s conspiracy. If a woman like Fox Queen was willing to disguise herself as a female guard, then something big had to be going down.
Han Sen had intended to glean more information from Cher. She was so pure that she looked rather inexperienced. But she actually seemed smart enough to deprive him of hope.
Cher moved her face closer to Han Sen. She was facing him, and she was so near that she almost touched Han Sen’s nose. They could feel each other’s breath.
“What are you doing? I have standards, you know,” Han Sen said with a blink.
“You really are Han Sen?” Cher asked curiously, still examining him.
“We are sleeping together, and still you must ask that? I feel rather hurt.” Han Sen lifted his shoulders in a light shrug.
Cher’s eyes looked like moons. She smiled and said, “I thought that we Foxes were very good at changing our identities, but you must be even better. You’ve disguised yourself as Extreme King’s Prince Sixteen and successfully avoided detection. Not even Fox Queen would have the courage to do what you’ve done.”
“I learned a few tricks from Fox Queen that made it possible,” Han Sen said.
Cher’s eyes looked bright. “Are you close with her?”
“Close. Very close. Fox Queen kind of wanted to marry me, but I didn’t want that to happen,” Han Sen casually said.
When Cher heard that, her eyes widened. She didn’t believe the claim. “Liar.”
“Why would I lie? Your Fox Queen’s butt has a...” Han Sen supplied some helpful descriptive details.
Cher looked at Han Sen as if he was a monster. A while later she said, “You and Fox Queen... That... That...”
“I failed her when I turned down her proposal.” Han Sen sighed. “Now I can only make up for it by trying to help her and assuage her grief. If I can do that, I can die a happy man.”
“You are going to help Fox Queen claim our treasure?” Cher felt touched as she spoke.
Han Sen felt a ripple of relief pass through him; Cher was much easier to deal with than other Foxes. While she was King class and strong, she didn’t have much practical experience.
In the morning, Han Sen finally received the Extreme King’s Pavilion Pass and left Night Charm Town. On his way out, he looked over at Cher like he wanted her so badly. Bai Ying Shuang wouldn’t let him near the woman now that their deal was complete, though.
The blood kirin had been sleeping, and nothing happened after it woke up. Han Sen didn’t know what they had done to the creature to make it sleep through the night.
Han Sen rode the blood kirin away from Night Charm Town, heading straight for the Extreme King’s Pavilion. He was in so much danger, and he felt as if he could be exposed at any second. He wanted to use Pavilion Pass as quickly as possible.
Considering Bai Yi’s well-known greed, everyone would expect him to use the pass immediately, anyway.
When he arrived at the Pavilion, Han Sen presented the pass so he could go right on in and select a treasure to take away with him. The blood kirin had to wait for him outside.
But when Han Sen entered the Pavilion, he frowned. The legends said that the place was full of treasures, but Han Sen didn’t see any treasures as he walked inside. There was just a bunch of statues.
The statues were wearing royal armor. Although they were just statues, the sight of them was still very impressive. Each statue must have represented one of the Extreme King’s former rulers.
Aside from those statues, there were no other treasures inside the building. Han Sen found a placard on the wall, and soon realized that the statues themselves were the treasures of the Extreme King’s Pavilion.
During a ruler’s coronation, a statue of the new ruler would be placed inside the Pavilion. The materials used to construct the statues weren’t very valuable, but before the statues were placed in the Pavilion, the kings left their geno arts inside them. If someone with a Pavilion Pass could understand the meaning of one of the geno arts, they would be able to activate the statue. The statue would move to reveal the treasure compartment at its base. Within that compartment would be an item left behind by the ruler.
“If these are items left behind by monarchs, then they must be quite special. But understanding the mind of a king cannot be an easy task to accomplish,” Han Sen thought as he looked at the statues.
Although each statue was unique, they all had a sense of power and mystique. As he looked closer, Han Sen could tell that the statues were all pulling on him in different ways. All of them possessed their own particular atmosphere.
There was seventy-nine of them. That meant at least seventy-nine kings had ruled the Extreme King during their history.
Some statues featured a rock in front of them, whereas others did not. If a statue didn’t have a stone, it meant that the treasure inside had already been taken.
Han Sen counted and realized there were only three of them left. Most of the treasures had already been taken, which meant that the ones left behind would be difficult to claim.
That made sense. The Extreme King had a long history, and there was an abundance of talented individuals among them. Understanding a statue wouldn’t be too difficult.
There were three that no one had managed to understand, though. That was quite odd.
Han Sen had a look at the three statues. Blocks of text were engraved on the back of each statue, chronicling the entire life of the king, feats and all.
The first of the statues that hadn’t been claimed was actually the first statue that Han Sen had seen upon entering. That meant the statue belonged to the Extreme King’s very first ruler, or maybe even their alpha.
The statue’s self-aggrandizement was quite ridiculous. It said that the king was loved by everyone. It spoke of how intelligent and powerful the man was, and how his hands could cripple the entire universe. It said he stabilized the universe for billions of years. Frankly, it just sounded ludicrous. It sounded as if the Extreme King had held the entire universe together.
But Han Sen knew that the Extreme King were once just a minor race. When their alpha was born, Sacred was the reigning superpower. Perhaps the Extreme King alpha had even owed service to the people of Sacred.
That was very likely, because when the Sacred leader spread his dominion over the universe, small races like the Extreme King would have found themselves under the thumb of the Sacred. In reality, most of them would have ended up as vassal races to the Sacred.
The strangest thing, though, was the physical appearance of the Extreme King’s alpha. His statue looked very different than those of the other kings.
The Extreme King looked similar to humans. The first king mostly resembled them, but part of his body was obviously different.
There was a mark on the alpha’s forehead that looked like the closed third eye of a Sky. The Extreme Kings didn’t have a third eye. They were just like humans; they had two eyes with normal pupils.
But then again, Han Sen couldn’t be certain what the marking was supposed to be. It wasn’t open, so he couldn’t be sure that it was actually a third eye.
There was another strange thing about the statue, as well. Every other king possessed a sword, knife, or a book. The alpha didn’t have a sword on his waist or a book in his hand, however; he was holding a gourd.
“This guy is interesting.” Han Sen focused on the alpha’s statue and used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to witness the process of the statue’s creation.
According to the statue’s description, the alpha left the statue in the Extreme King’s Pavilion. The alpha both started this tradition and wrote it down in the rules of the Extreme King, and every king after had performed this ritual. If the ritual wasn’t completed, then they wouldn’t be deemed a true king of the Extreme King.
Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to look at the statue, but before he could analyze a single thing, he felt a burning pain sear into his eye.
“Argh!”
Han Sen lowered his head and held his eye. Thin trails of blood leaked through his fingers.
“That is some strong power.” Han Sen clutched his eye, and it took a while for him to recover. He didn’t dare use the Purple-Eye Butterfly to examine the statue again. Although the Purple-Eye Butterfly was a deified beast soul, the alpha of the Extreme King must have been a very powerful individual. They would have been deified, too. Trying to steal a look into the statue that they left behind was clearly a no-go.
Luckily, Han Sen’s recovery power was strong. If it hadn’t been, his eye would have been destroyed.
Putting away the Purple-Eye Butterfly, Han Sen didn’t look at the Extreme King alpha’s statue again. Instead, he looked at the statue of another king.
That king was holding a book, with his spare hand held behind his back. His eyes looked into the distance, and they conveyed an intimidating sense of incredible strength.
Han Sen observed the statue and noticed how startlingly clear it was. The king had black eyes and black hair. He wasn’t clad in the armor of a king, but instead dressed in a white robe that actually looked rather elegant.
The back of the statue recorded what the king had done. Han Sen learned that this king was called King Wen. The description of his deeds said that he fought wars and claimed races, but that part of his life was summed up in a single sentence. Most of his description explained how he built the system of law and government for the Extreme King.
King Bai was actually following the laws established by King Wen, like the rules to raise the royal children. Through the eras, things had been modified a bit, but the rules remained mostly the same.
King Wen was the second king of the Extreme King. His statue was near the Extreme King alpha.
The final statue that hadn’t been claimed was far in the back. It was the king before King Bai.
Because King Bai was still around, his statue was sealed. Treasure seekers would have to wait until he had passed away before his statue was revealed in the Pavilion.
The statue wasn’t being shown right then to avoid giving his children the opportunity to crack the statue. Why that would have been a bad thing, the stone didn’t say. As a result, Han Sen didn’t understand.
The last king before King Bai was called King Bao. Not much was written about him, just a few words that looked like default-text instead. He had beaten a race and expanded the breadth of the Extreme King’s domain, but the name of the race he had beaten wasn’t even listed.
The expanse controlled by the Extreme King had been maximized during the reign of King Bao, so there wasn’t much room left for them to develop nowadays unless they could defeat the Very High or Ancient God. There was nothing else King Bai could do.
In fact, the twenty kings before King Bao were all fairly boring. They maintained the Extreme King’s power and developed fairly slowly.
But those other king statues had all been claimed. This boring and normal king statue hadn’t been cracked, though.
Although the King Bao statue was the latest to show up, not many had attempted to understand it. Its plain look might have been why, even though King Bai was known to have some genius kids, like Bai Wuchang and Bai Ling Shuang. They were geniuses with a vast array of talents. Bai Wei was talented, as well, but she lacked fame. There were many royal children of greatness, just hidden away like that. If they didn’t have what it took to claim the King Bao statue, then it had to be special.
Han Sen looked at the three statues. He was unable to use his Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a close-up examination of them. He would need to use his own senses. Plus, no matter how many Pavilion Passes a prince got ahold of, they could never come back once they claimed a statue.
Bai Wuchang had tried to open the alpha statue before, and he wasn’t the only prince that had tried.
Han Sen turned toward the strange face of the alpha statue. “I’ll give this one a try.”
Each statue had a different atmosphere, but Han Sen felt his attention being snared by the gourd that the alpha king was holding. Han Sen couldn’t tell if that was a good thing or a bad thing.
Perhaps because of Bao’er, Han Sen cared a lot about things that resembled a gourd.
King Bao’s name had a Bao in it, but he didn’t have any weapons or interesting items in his hands. He looked so poor, and so that wasn’t what Han Sen wanted.
King Wen didn’t suit Han Sen’s style. Only the alpha king interested Han Sen.
Han Sen sat down before the alpha king statue and looked up into the man’s eyes.
For some reason, the oppressive aura of the statue felt different when he was sitting down.
If Han Sen looked at the statue while he was on his feet, the statue appeared beautiful and intricately carved. When he sat on the floor, however, it seemed as if the statue was truly coming alive. It was like a living king was standing in front of him, looking at Han Sen with what appeared to be a smile. The emotions it inspired were completely different.
Han Sen was shocked. He moved a little on the stone and looked at the statue again. The statue was back to normal. It didn’t look alive anymore.
Han Sen changed spots a few times, but the results were the same. He could only see the statue’s living-type aura when he sat directly in front of it.
Han Sen ran to King Wen and King Bao’s statues. They were all the same. Only sitting on the stone allowed him to detect the feel of the statues.
“These king statues are amazing. I wonder how they do that.” Han Sen sighed. He returned to his seat in front of the alpha king’s statue and analyzed the feelings inspired by the statue.
When he looked at the alpha, a strange feeling settled over Han Sen. King Wen and King Bao’s statues gave Han Sen the feeling that he was sitting before a god and a devil, respectively. They thrummed with strength that could rattle the whole universe, and the things they knew were very mysterious. It was like even the folds of their sleeves were jam-packed full of knowledge.
The alpha king was different, though. He was holding a gourd, and it looked as if he was smiling. He looked like an elderly neighbor who would sit outside the door smoking. He didn’t look like an all-powerful tyrant. Han Sen didn’t know if his mind was playing tricks on him, but Han Sen thought the old man’s eyes looked rather horny.
“This alpha king is very interesting,” Han Sen thought curiously. He carefully inspected the whole body, not willing to overlook a single part.
But no matter where he looked, Han Sen couldn’t discern anything meaningful from it. The statue had a spirit, but there was no sense of godly might. It was just very plain.
King Wen and King Bai’s statues elicited feelings that were scary to experience. Alpha king’s feelings were very weak by comparison. It was difficult to understand.
Han Sen sat in front of the statue for a whole day, but he was unable to learn a single thing. He frowned. He didn’t know if he should give up on the alpha king, as King Wen and King Bao had enticing amounts of power.
But Han Sen really cared about the gourd. He hesitated and stopped looking at the alpha king. He turned his attention to focus on the gourd instead.
Han Sen looked at it for a while, and he soon felt something weird.
Before, when Han Sen looked at a statue, he had focused on the king himself. The gourd was just an accessory, so there was nothing special to glean from looking at it.
But if he changed his perspective to center on the gourd as the primary aspect of the statue, then the king was actually the accessory, and things looked very different.
The children of the Extreme King were full of pride. They carried pride in every part of their lives, but it centered on their ancestors. They always showed them a great deal of respect. No one would even consider that the alpha king was just an accessory or a slave to the gourd.
Han Sen was an outsider. He wasn’t one of the Extreme King, so he didn’t share their thought processes. He really took the gourd seriously. He looked at it as if it was far more than a trinket, and by doing so, the entire statue took on a different meaning. It was as if he was stepping through a gate into a new world.
As Han Sen channeled his focus into the gourd instead of the king, his emotions changed entirely.
Realization slowly dawned on his face. The more he watched the gourd, the more familiar he thought it was. It looked like Bao’er before she was born.
“No way! The Extreme King alpha is holding a gourd, and the gourd is a statue of Bao’er before she was born?” Han Sen thought in complete shock.
Han Sen determined that the gourd was indeed Bao’er. The meaning of the gourd became clearer. A mysterious air began to spread, and it looked as if it was wrapping Han Sen up inside it.
“This gourd statue, it cannot be Bao’er who created it, surely.” Han Sen continued to stare at the statue, his expression cycling rapidly through emotions.
“Master, Bai Yi has entered the Pavilion,” Cher said with a bow to Bai Ling Shuang.
Bai Ling Shuang was seated on a sofa. Her beautiful legs were up, and she was holding a wine glass that she slowly twirled. Her expression changed to disdain, and she said, “Now that Bai Wuchang has used his pass, the Pavilion only has the statues of the alpha, the second king, and King Bao. The alpha and the second king’s statues have been there for billions of years, as no one has been able to understand them. And as for that King Bao, he was a strange king. Many royal children have tried to understand his statue, but they left empty-handed. There is no way Bai Yi will be able to understand anything about the statue.”
“Instead of asking for a reward that he could use more easily, Bai Yi insisted that he be given a Pavilion Pass. He does think a little too highly of himself,” Cher said.
Bai Ling Shuang’s lips tasted the wine. Then, she set the glass down. “In this world, the hardest thing isn’t understanding the enemy; it’s understanding yourself. Bai Yi isn’t the only person who struggles with that. Even with all the elites in our race, how many of them can truly claim to understand themselves? Bai Yi is just an ordinary man. It isn’t surprising that he asked for something beyond his capabilities. He won’t learn his limitations until he has tried it for himself.”
“You are correct, master. After all, there are not many people in this universe who are as insightful as you,” Cher gushed.
Bai Ling Shang looked at Cher and coldly said, “Your Fox tricks do not work on me.”
“I apologize,” Cher said immediately.
Bai Ling Shuang waved her hand, and she was about to respond when a look of shock crossed her face. She went to the balcony and looked up into the sky.
From another planet, a beam of light was shooting across the universe, casting shadows across entire planets.
“The Pavilion... That is impossible!” Bai Ling Shuang stared at the light in utter disbelief.
Every person of the Extreme King was in shock as they turned their heads up toward the beam of light coursing through the skies.
That light seemed born from powerful magic. As people looked at it, it seemed less like a king than a god or a devil. The scary presence was felt all over King’s Kingdom.
Under the gaze of all those royals in King’s Kingdom, the light moved. It started punching. It was the Extreme King’s most basic skill: Extreme King Punch.
The Extreme King’s geno arts were all derived from the Extreme King Punch. Even Bai Wei’s Extreme King Final Punch was an improved version of Extreme King Punch.
But this basic example of Extreme King Punch was shown through a shadow. It was hard to imagine how scary it was. Every punch seemed to hold enough power to break the universe.
As the nobles watched those punches, their hearts leaped in their chests. They were suppressed, and they found it difficult to breathe. It felt as if every punch they saw was going to cripple the whole universe, crushing them in the process.
Just watching that power coming from the punches was enough to put everyone in a daze. Those with weak wills found blood trickling from their noses and ears.
“This... our alpha... is it...?”
“Has someone claimed the alpha statue?”
“Who... who is this...?”
Almost everyone was wondering, especially the royal children. Even the nearby nobles were shocked.
It had been billions of years, and in all that time, no one had been able to claim it. The opening of that statue would shake the very foundation of their society.
No matter which prince or princess claimed the alpha statue, this was going to draw King Bai’s attention. If the royal child was already known to be incredibly talented, then this might be enough for them to usurp the place of the current crown prince.
After all, the crown prince wasn’t really very famous. The current crown prince had been selected only because he was the eldest son of the king. King Bai could boot that crown prince off his pedestal whenever he wanted to.
Bai Wei watched the alpha’s shadow of Extreme King Punch. She seemed to learn something as she stared. She followed what she saw in the sky and started to move, punch after punch. Her punches started off very complicated, but they became very simple. Her final punch became the most basic Shocking Sky Punch.
But her body was becoming stronger. It was becoming closer with the shadow of their alpha.
Katcha!
Some sort of lock inside Bai Wei appeared to have been broken. Her original body became an astral body, but the development didn’t end there. Following the alpha’s shadow punch, Bai Wei’s body continued to increase. She was fast going to have a celestial body.
This wasn’t just happening to Bai Wei, either. The whole of the Extreme King—every single person that practiced Shocking Sky Punch or something similar to it—began to gain strength because of that shadow. Many elites broke their boundaries, and even King class and deified sorts gained more power.
“So this is the power of our legendary alpha... He is so holy... Who did this? Who is the one that claimed the alpha statue?” Everyone was both shocked and exuberantly delighted by this turn of events, and they discussed rabidly between themselves.
The most likely candidate, they presumed, was Bai Wuchang. But he had already claimed a statue for himself. There was no way he would be allowed to go back to the Pavilion to grab another, so it couldn’t be him.
Others of royalty were powerful, too. No one could guess who it might have been.
Only Bai Ling Shuang’s expression was conflicted. She knew Bai Yi was in the Pavilion at that moment, but she was unable to fathom how Bai Yi, of all people, could have opened the alpha statue.
“It cannot be Bai Yi. There is probably some other royal child inside the Pavilion.” Bai Ling Shuang gritted her teeth as she spoke.
The light that came from the Pavilion began to fade, taking the alpha shadow with it. Many nobles and Extreme King elites looked towards the Pavilion. They wanted to know who had claimed the alpha statue.
King Bai was inside the palace, playing a game of chess. He held one of the pieces in his hand, forgotten, as he stared toward the Pavilion.
“Congratulations, my king, on having such a good son.” The person who was playing with King Bai smiled.
“Teacher, which prince do you think it is?” King Bai asked levelly, putting down a white chess piece.
It was the Extreme King’s National Teacher, known as Ancient Abyss, who was playing chess with him. The teacher looked like a forty-year-old man. He looked quite handsome with his little beard, but it did make him look older. Despite that, he looked quite dreamy and light.
Ancient Abyss bowed and said, “I do not know.”
King Bai didn’t ask any more questions. He looked in the direction of the Pavilion, waiting for the prince or princess that claimed the alpha king to emerge.
Han Sen, in the Extreme King’s Pavilion, was shocked. He’d only wanted a small reward for his efforts with the statue. He hadn’t intended to draw much attention, and now he frowned worriedly.
If he really was Bai Yi, he’d have been overjoyed. But he was only masquerading as Bai Yi, and now that he had caused so much of a disturbance, everyone was sure to turn their focus on him. His chances of being exposed were now incredibly high.
“What’s done is done, so there’s no point in worrying about it now. I’ll just take the item for now.” Han Sen looked at the space within the alpha statue. The opening had been revealed.
Through the opening was a square hole which held a wooden box around the size of a football. Han Sen pulled the box out, and the statue returned to how it had been when he first saw it.
Han Sen returned to sit in front of the statue. It didn’t have the sense of life that it had possessed before. It seemed that the statue really had become what it was supposed to be: a statue. There were no further hidden meanings to its existence, and the gourd in the statue’s hand didn’t summon that feeling of familiarity that it once had.
“The statue really can only be activated once.” Han Sen was looking at the wooden box. He thought to himself, “This is what the alpha of the Extreme King left behind. It cannot be anything lame, surely. It must be a deified weapon or something of the sort.”
The box wasn’t locked, and when Han Sen opened it up, he was given a shock.
The wooden box held a jade gourd about the size of Han Sen’s hand. It looked like a green crystal. The crystal seemed transparent, but Han Sen couldn’t see what was inside it.
“This jade gourd must have been carved. It isn’t a creature. Perhaps it’s a bottle shaped like a gourd?” Han Sen took the jade gourd out the box, but the gourd was entirely whole. There was no hole or seam that he could find.
Judging from the weight and feel, it didn’t seem hollow, though. It was made of solid jade.
Han Sen looked at the green gourd, and when he looked at its bottom, his fingers trembled. The bottom was flat, and a few words were carved on it.
“For the leader of Sacred only.” Han Sen was given a proper shock after reading those words.
As far as Han Sen knew, there was only one “leader of Sacred.” And this thing was from the Extreme King alpha. This couldn’t have been some nameless, meaningless item.
“Is the alpha of the Extreme King connected to the leader of Sacred? Otherwise, why would the Extreme King alpha have an item that belonged to the Sacred leader? Perhaps the Extreme King alpha received it sometime after the Sacred leader died. I still think they are related, though,” Han Sen thought to himself.
Han Sen turned the jade gourd over in his hands to study it. He couldn’t tell what it did.
“Whatever, I’ll just take it with me for now.” Han Sen put the jade gourd in his chest pocket. Then he picked up the wooden box and exited the Pavilion.
He knew many people would be watching the Pavilion, but he had no choice but to leave. He couldn’t stay there forever. He had to make an exit eventually.
Even though he had gone through a lot of things, in the face of something like this, even Han Sen was quite nervous. He couldn’t be certain of avoiding exposure now, with all the eyes watching him and his disguise of Bai Yi.
“Bai Yi! He is the one who...?” When Han Sen walked out of the Pavilion, all the Extreme King elites were surprised.
Many high level people knew that Bai Yi had used Return to Origin on Han Sen. The only people that didn’t know Bai Yi now looked like Han Sen were the few who didn’t read the news.
Even if they knew he was Bai Yi, though, they were still stunned. Even King Bai and Ancient Abyss were frightfully shocked. They hadn’t expected Bai Yi to have been the one to understand the statue.
“That is a rare occurrence, indeed,” King Bai said, as he watched. That was all he said, and no one knew exactly what he meant by the cryptic remark.
Ancient Abyss looked at Han Sen. Then, he turned back to King Bai. “How lucky. Congratulations, your majesty.”
“Luck has nothing to do with it,” King Bai said in a cool voice.
The other elites were even more shocked than King Bai. When Bai Wei looked at Han Sen, she felt a complex flurry of emotions.
Bai Ling Shuang’s face kept changing and twitching. When Miss Mirror looked at Han Sen, she frowned in thought.
Among the Extreme King, that day would be remembered for its stunning revelation. Prince Sixteen, Bai Yi, had claimed the alpha’s statue. It was like a miracle.
The alpha’s statue had been there for billions of years, and no one had been able to understand what was inside it. And Prince Sixteen, Bai Yi, who already had a bad reputation, had been the one to claim it. Everyone had their socks blown off.
When Han Sen rode the blood kirin back to Planet Water Zone, even the Princess Lan Haixin couldn’t help but stare at him from atop the palace.
Lan Haixin didn’t understand how Bai Yi had been able to claim the alpha king’s statue. She found it a very hard thing to believe.
Han Sen returned to his little building, closed the door, then started to play with his jade gourd. Aside from the words mentioning it was for the Sacred leader only, there was nothing else special about it. He couldn’t feel any special power residing inside it, despite searching it as thoroughly as he could.
Han Sen had a look at it with his Purple-Eye Butterfly, and there was nothing to witness. But, that did prove that the jade gourd was unusual.
“It is a shame Bao’er has gone undercover with Lan Haixin. It would be great if she was here. The statue’s gourd is so similar to Bao’er. Perhaps the jade gourd really is related to her,” Han Sen mused.
“Dad!” As Han Sen was lost in thought, Bao’er came jumping toward him, holding a variety of packages in her small arms.
“Bao’er, why are you back?” Han Sen was shocked. Bao’er was holding lots of food, and none of the goodies looked cheap. Her clothes were very pretty, too, and they obviously followed the fashion trends of the Siren.
“I missed you, Dad!” Bao’er leaped into Han Sen’s chest and rubbed her face against Han Sen’s.
“Dad missed Bao’er, too. But Bao’er, did Lan Haixin’s people see you coming?” Han Sen was hoping Bao’er had been able to get some information while he was away.
“Don’t worry. No one saw me.” Bao’er gave the food to Han Sen. “You must have been eating bad food while you were alone. Allow me to give you the good stuff.”
“Good good! You are so nice. You are the best daughter that a daddy could ask for.” Han Sen merrily accepted the food and started eating. Filled with curiosity, he handed Bao’er the jade gourd. “Bao’er, do you recognize what this is?”
Bao’er accepted the jade gourd and shook it. Then, she turned it upside-down. Something like water poured out of the jade gourd.
Han Sen was given another shock. He had thought the jade gourd was solid. He hadn’t realized that there was something hidden away inside.
The liquid that came out of the gourd looked like water, but it wasn’t. When the liquid came out, it didn’t flow out onto the floor. It floated in the air, and it looked like a floating fairy. Rather than dividing into droplets, the fairy held together in a single floating pool. It looked similar to Han Sen using the Original Water King Body.
“What is this? Han Sen was given another shock.
“Help Daddy to shower,” Bao’er directed the water fairy as she held the gourd.
The water fairy came over to Han Sen and stripped all his clothes off. Then she twirled her finger, and a water air wrapped around Han Sen’s entire body. It made him feel as if he was in the embrace of a natural spring.
The water fairy sat behind Han Sen and massaged his shoulders. Han Sen was definitely enjoying the massage, but he was disappointed and couldn’t help but say, “It’s just a servant?”
It had taken a lot of work for Han Sen to get into the Pavilion, and he had also risked exposure. It wasn’t worth it if he had only gotten a servant girl for his efforts.
Bao’er leaned her head to the side and said, “I don’t know, but I think that she has another function.”
“Can she fight?” Han Sen asked.
Bao’er lifted the gourd and pointed at the chair. She shouted, “Hit it!”
The water fairy went to the chair immediately, but her watery body broke as soon as she came into contact with it. The chair moved a little, but no actual lasting damage had been done.
“It looks as if she doesn’t.” Bao’er shook her head.
“This can’t be the servant of the Sacred leader. The Extreme King’s alpha surely wouldn’t be this lame, leaving behind such a weak item for his children.” Han Sen looked at the water fairy.
Bao’er asked the water fairy to give her a massage. The water fairy complied with the directive immediately, so it seemed as if she lacked a will of her own. It was a high class doll.
Han Sen used his Purple-Eye Butterfly to get a better look at the water fairy, and what he saw shocked him. The water fairy’s body was an energy substance, and it was very tightly constructed. It seemed to contain a deified power, the likes of which Han Sen hadn’t seen before.
“Weird. Such strong power, but why doesn’t it deal any damage? What does this thing actually do?” Han Sen thought to himself as he looked at the water fairy.
Bao’er was having fun with it, at least. While the water fairy was rubbing her shoulders, Bao’er also instructed it to begin feeding her.
“Bao’er, how do I make use of this jade gourd?” Han Sen asked after a moment of thought. Perhaps using the gourd himself would let him investigate it further.
“It’s easy. Just put your energy into the gourd.” Bao’er handed it back to Han Sen.
After the gourd left Bao’er’s hand, the water fairy shattered and returned to the jade gourd like liquid.
Han Sen tried putting his power into the jade gourd, but he couldn’t make it work. Then he tried it again, and when he put his power inside it, the jade gourd worked. The water fairy bound itself to Han Sen’s will and emerged from the jade gourd.
“This thing is strange, but I really don’t know what she does.” Han Sen tried a few commands, making sure he was able to control the water fairy. Then, he put the jade gourd and the water fairy away.
“Bao’er, did you get any information from your time with Lan Haixin?” Han Sen asked Bao’er.
Bao’er nodded and said, “She and Bai Yi had a meeting arranged for the ninth of next month. They will be opening the relic, and she says Bai Yi has the genes of another race in him. But the genes aren’t complete. She says the chances that the relic will select Bai Yi are low. She thinks she will be able to control the relic.”
“Did she tell you what the relic might have been?” Han Sen asked further, pleased with the revelations.
“No.” Bao’er shook her head and swallowed some food.
“Good. Keep gathering all the information you can. Once you have found something, try to find a way to reach me,” Han Sen said with a smile.
“I promise I will do that.” Bao’er looked so serious, and she gave Han Sen a salute.
“Good. You are the pride of the people and the nation, and you are the pride of your daddy, too.” Han Sen convinced Bao’er to go back. Then, he got to thinking about what he himself might need to do.
The little red bird followed after Bao’er, but Han Sen didn’t worry about her.
Han Sen was most worried about the ramifications of the previous day. He hadn’t known that opening the alpha statue would cause so much trouble, and right now, the entire Extreme King society was still in the midst of dealing with their shock. Many eyes would be focused on him in the times to come.
“Considering Bai Yi’s pride and desire for attention, he wouldn’t maintain a low profile after suddenly becoming so famous. I need to go somewhere.” Han Sen got to thinking about where he should go.
Han Sen looked at the blood kirin, and then his eyes turned bright. “Yes! I should make the blood kirin register as my royal guard. Then, I can go to King’s Garden to steal a primary root king dragon. Only the princes and princesses are allowed to go to King’s Garden. No one there is deified. I still can’t reveal myself, but at least I won’t be left exposed to the people most likely to see through my disguise. And I can steal plenty of resources. Right, I should do that. I should go to King’s Garden.”
After Han Sen said that, he took the blood kirin with him and registered it as a royal guard. Then, he rushed to King’s Garden.
“My Prince, Bai Yi has left home. He took the blood kirin to register as a royal guard. And now, he is going to King’s Garden.”
“My Princess, Bai Yi took the blood kirin to King’s Garden.”
The same report was delivered to each and every palace. Many princes and princesses now raced to King’s Garden.
They wanted to know what was going on with Bai Yi. The idea that he had claimed the alpha’s statue was way too strange, and many royal children thought it was suspicious.
“He is out? I want to see if this is actually Bai Yi, or if it is really Han Sen.” Miss Mirror was holding a big mirror that reflected Han Sen’s movement inside King’s Garden. She paid special attention to the ring Han Sen was still wearing. Every few seconds, Miss Mirror would turn her eyes to glance at that ring. Then, she unconsciously touched the identical ring she wore on her own finger.
Han Sen had gone there with Bai Wei once, so he knew the way to go. He brought the blood kirin with him to King’s Garden.
Han Sen wasn’t fond of the bearded dragons, and he rode the blood kirin towards the king tree. He wanted to find one of those thick, primary root king dragons.
But as soon as the blood kirin started to move, a few shadows appeared before them. Han Sen examined them and realized it was a bunch of people he had never seen before.
He recognized some of them from the information Mister White had given him, however. The first one was Prince Swordstar. He was the forty-seventh royal child, and he was Bai Yi’s little brother. But he wasn’t from the same mother.
“Brother Forty-Seven, why are you blocking my way?” Han Sen asked, his expression gloomy.
Prince Swordstar smiled. He looked quite handsome as he said, “I am here to congratulate you, Brother Sixteen, on acquiring an understanding of the Extreme King alpha. And I am curious what the Extreme King alpha left behind in the Pavilion. I hope you will be able to tell me.”
“And what if I don’t tell you?” Han Sen asked with a chuckle.
“Then this little brother is going to have to teach you a lesson,” Prince Swordstar said coldly.
“Ha! You aren’t worthy of challenging me. Beat my guard first,” Han Sen replied haughtily.
The blood kirin roared. A red mist covered its body, exerting intense pressure on the surrounding area. A blood shadow came right for Prince Swordstar.
“You aren’t the only one who has a guard.” Prince Swordstar’s face didn’t change. Without a command, his own guard leaped out to fight the blood kirin.
King class was divided into nine different tiers. Becoming half-deified required a person to break through all nine tiers. A further barrier had to be surpassed before someone could become fully deified.
Instead of being recognized separately, these nine tiers were typically just grouped under King class, however. The power of a King’s area-of-effect grew with each tier that was surpassed.
The blood kirin had completed all nine tiers; it was half-deified, after all. Prince Swordstar’s guard was a half-deified elite, too.
“How dare you behave so poorly in front of a prince!” That half-deified guard made a cow’s mooing sound. He then released a yellow king area, which overlapped with the blood kirin’s blood area. The guard lifted the axe in his hand and ran forward to strike the blood kirin.
The blood area combined with the yellow area, and both guards were affected by each other. A sudden weight fell across the blood kirin’s body, as if it had suddenly shouldered the weight of a mountain.
The yellow area was associated with the element of earth, and it created earth elemental pressure within its zone. Kings with poor bodies could very well find themselves crushed by that pressure.
As the blood kirin was pressed down by the earth power, the guard’s axe came towards the creature like a mountain. It was aimed to come down on the blood kirin’s head. The power exerted would have been enough to cut an entire planet in half.
Roar!
The blood kirin roared. Instead of trying to avoid the strike, it used its own horn to block the falling axe.
Boom!
The blood and yellow powers surged against each other. The blood kirin’s horn was able to block the big axe, keeping the axe aloft.
The half-deified guard roared. He struggled to push his big axe down further, as the two powers kept crashing against each other in the area.
Han Sen and Prince Swordstar watched the two from afar. Suddenly, a massive red and yellow explosion rocked the area. The blood kirin was able to get past the half-deified guard.
When the light of the explosion faded and the onlookers could see again, they immediately noticed that the blood kirin’s neck scales were torn. There was a huge cleft across them, and the blood kirin’s blood began to drip slowly down its chest.
The chestplate of the half-deified guard’s armor had also been broken. He had been cut, and he was bleeding, as well.
“Very strong body! You did not die after taking a blow from my Open Sky Axe, but still, you will die today,” the half-deified guard shouted fiercely. His Open Sky Axe produced a scary light, and it came swinging at the blood kirin again.
The blood kirin lowered its head. Its eyes looked red. Then the eyes grew darker and darker, until they ended up looking black.
Han Sen understood the blood kirin well, and he knew now that it was really angry. Its blood air was about to go mad. It was like a nuclear bomb that was on the verge of detonating.
As the half-deified guard sprang toward it, the blood kirin did not dodge. It raised its head and peered at the guard. The blood air in its eyes was about to erupt like a volcano.
Blergh!
The power from the blood kirin’s eyes didn’t explode out as Han Sen had expected. The other guard’s chest suddenly started to rupture with blood.
His Open Sky Axe didn’t come down as planned. Blood spurted from his wound like a spring, and everyone watching the fight looked on in shock. The half-deified guard quickly tried to cast a power to stop his loss of blood.
But it was a futile effort. Blood still streamed out of his chest, then turned into a mist and drifted straight over to the blood kirin, where the blood kirin promptly absorbed it.
The wound on the blood kirin’s neck soon closed up as if it had never existed.
The blood kirin roared like a lion. It became a blood shadow, then flew over to the half-deified guard.
The half-deified guard was bleeding, and his face looked shocked at the turn of events. He roared in response and swung his Open Sky Axe at the blood kirin once more, desperately trying to slash the incoming blood kirin.
The blood kirin made no attempt to evade the big axe, and neither did it try to use its claws to block the blow. The beast allowed the axe to slam into it and cut a deep crevice across its scales. At the same time, though, the blood kirin’s talons touched down on its opponent.
As the guard screamed, his blood sprayed like a geyser.
The murderous blood kirin ignored the frantic blows of the axe, using its scales to absorb the strikes as its claws continued shredding the guard’s armor and tearing up his flesh.
The blood kirin’s claws left marks all across the knight, and blood spilled ceaselessly from his body. His blood was like a volcano, and nothing could stop that eruption.
Han Sen grinned as he watched. The blood kirin’s blood area was a very scary ability. Han Sen was fortunate that the blood kirin was not his enemy.
Instead, when the guard hit the blood kirin with the big axe, it was now able to heal so quickly.
After a moment, the half-deified guard was broken. He screamed continuously as he tried to scramble away, but under the grip of the blood kirin’s blood area, he had lost too much blood. His powers were now weak, and he no longer had the strength to run.
The blood kirin was like a wolf. It was like a tiger. It leaped over towards the man, then ripped off his arms and swallowed them. Crunching noises came from the creature as it savored its snack.
“Prince! Save... save me!” the half-deified screamed to Prince Swordstar.
Prince Swordstar felt a bitter chill strike him after watching all this. The cruelty of the blood kirin shocked him and all the other guards.
Before Prince Swordstar could say anything, the blood kirin picked up the guard in its mouth and ate him whole.
A half-deified elite had been completely swallowed by the blood kirin. The man’s last scream still echoed in the ears of the horrified audience.
“Bai Yi... You killed my guard...” Prince Swordstar looked very ill. His eyes stared blankly ahead.
“It was just a guard, and he died. What’s the big deal? If you are not happy about it, the blood kirin is willing to hear your complaints. Go and kill it, if you dare,” Han Sen replied flatly.
“You...” Prince Swordstar’s face had darkened. He wasn’t half-deified. He only had two half-deified guards in his employ, and now one of them had been eaten by the blood kirin. Sending another one into the fray would not help.
Other princes and princesses watched the fight from afar, looking jealously at the blood kirin.
“I didn’t expect that Han Sen’s xenogeneic would be so strong; it is like it is deified already! I cannot believe that *sshole Bai Yi was able to claim it.” When Bai Ling Shuang saw the blood kirin’s performance, the sight made her grumble angrily.
“If you have nothing else to say, Brother Forty-Seven, then I best be on my way.” Han Sen mounted the blood kirin again and looked at Prince Swordstar with disdain. Then he headed towards the king tree.
Prince Swordstar’s face kept cycling through a number of emotions, but he let Han Sen go and did not press for another fight.
Prince Swordstar wasn’t willing to continue the contest, but Bai Ling Shuang and the other royal children still followed Han Sen. They could see he was getting close to the king tree.
“Is he going to practice in front of the king tree?” Bai Ling Shang frowned, her expression turning strange.
Han Sen thought he would find more primary root king dragons closer to the tree, but that wasn’t the case. The ground closest to the king tree was different, and normal royal children wouldn’t dare to approach it. That was why Bai Ling Shuang looked so disturbed.
